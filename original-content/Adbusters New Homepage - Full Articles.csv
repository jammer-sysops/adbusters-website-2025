And why did no one on Wall Street go to jail after the meltdown of 2008?</p><p id="""">It’s all a mystery to me.</p><p id="""">But I think maybe I’ve been looking in the wrong place. Maybe the answer isn’t in <em id="""">The New York Times, The Guardian</em>, the CBS evening news or the books I’ve been reading.</p><p id="""">My new theory is that a long time ago, capitalism got infected with a virus. And that virus seized control of its host and began to deform it. Capitalism drifted from its origins in honest trade between two parties, with both walking away satisfied. The purity of that transaction gradually got eaten away, until now, a millennium later, we have . . . whatever it is we have today. Junk capitalism. Predatory capitalism. Or simply a “death cult,” as Jia Tolentino called it.</p><p id="""">If this really is a doomsday sect then it all starts to make sense, this place we ended up. With the dehumanization of personal exchange. The explosive tension between rich and poor. The constant threat of speculative bubbles and ecological tipping points.</p><p id="""">And maybe the virus, the actual virus, the one that has taken root in the heart of the global economy is . . .</p><p id="""">Money itself.</p><p id="""">This thing that has grown and grown until it casts an immense cultural shadow, eclipsing security and trust and freedom and even love.<br></p><p id="""">The story of this infection begins the moment we replace gift- giving and straight-on barter with some symbolic object: a shell, a coin, a paper note. This early money is a harmless, necessary thing — a placeholder for my chicken and your promise to build me a chicken coop. A portable bit of value that says, “Yes, I’m good for it ...” It’s a leap of faith, really. We agree to believe in the value of the things being exchanged. We look each other in the eye and say <em id="""">yes</em>, together.</p><p id="""">But the thing about “trust me” is that there are no guarantees. Our best intentions are vulnerable to outside interference. This is what the old myths were about, how we puny humans are powerless when the gods start moving the furniture around.</p><p id="""">And so as more and more distance creeps in, as money becomes more abstract, the virus mutates into ever more deadly strains.</p><p id="""">In his marvelous book <em id="""">The Structures of Everyday Life: Civilization and Capitalism 15th–18th Century</em>, historian Fernand Braudel tracks the gradual insinuation of the money economy into the lives of medieval peasants. “What did it actually bring? Sharp variations in prices of essential foodstuffs. Incomprehensible relationships in which man no longer recognized either himself, his customs or his ancient values.” His work became a commodity. And he himself became a “thing.”</p><p id="""">Because, see, as soon as there’s money, lo and behold someone shows up whose job it is to . . . handle it. To keep track of our affairs for us. And naturally they need to make a living — just a little off the top.</p><p id="""">So now there’s this third party in the mix, between you and me, between my chicken and your promise to build me a chicken coop. A middleman. He isn’t part of the actual exchange, but he’s taking a cut of our trade.</p><p id="""">And holy hell, that is the job to have. Because unlike our original transaction, there are no limits to it. Making money off of money is pure magic. That guy can get ahead no matter which way the wind blows. It’s a sweet deal, because now there’s real wealth to be had — it’s in the currency itself — silver coins, gold ingots, printed notes.</p><p id="""">A purity of intention used to run through the village: we are neighbors; we are trading partners. We are tight. What can I give you, brother? But now things have changed. You could be ripped off. So you look at that transaction with your neighbor with a touch of suspicion. Human interactions are no longer holy but transactional — every move has become a cost-benefit calculation.</p><p id="""">Alienation creeps in.<br></p><p id="""">The Catholic Church has a lot to answer for in all this. In 1095, it made a move no one saw coming: it started selling papal indulgences. This changed the very nature of money. Money was now this thing so powerful you could buy your way into heaven with it.</p><p id="""">What a great business model for the church. The exploitation of medieval fears of damnation proved so successful that the sale of indulgences became an industry. Usury. Debt and the erasure of debt, a gateway to unfathomable riches.<br></p><p id="""">Let the colonial pillaging begin!<br></p><p id="""">When the Spanish conquistadores landed in the Caribbean and put slaves to work extracting gold, some mothers opted to kill their children and themselves rather than die slowly in the mines. For those Spanish sailors, looting and murdering with a view to earning more and more and more, the drive wasn’t greed so much as shame and desperation. Everyone was caught in a debt trap. Living to pay off high-interest loans for their supplies and excursions. They could never get out of the hole. They sold their souls trying.</p><p id="""">Usury was the original sin. Something horrible happened at that moment, in the West, when we started going down that path.<br></p><p id="""">But this isn’t really a story about money. It’s about the choices we made to allow money to shape us. The moment money started using us, rather than the other way around.</p><p id="""">So when was the tipping point? When did money stop being a tool and become . . . a craving?</p><p id="""">Was it in the Middle Ages, when the goldsmiths who were storing folks’ savings in their vaults realized they could crib a bit and issue receipts for money they didn’t actually have in the vaults? That was the moment deceit got baked into the banking system.</p><p id="""">Or was it in 1971, when President Nixon abandoned the gold standard — unhitching global currency from any real value at all?</p><p id="""">Or was it 2008, when, as the banking crisis threatened to hobble the world economy, the governments of industrial nations used three trillion dollars of taxpayer money to bail out private financial institutions?</p><p id="""">At what point did it become clear that money is simply a fiction?</p><p id="""">And that those in charge of the storytelling hold the real power in a culture?</p><p id="""">In truth there was no single moment that money became the lifeblood of our civilization, any more than there is a single identifiable moment when a virus starts making you sick.<br></p><p id="""">And so here we are, in the endgame of financialized speculation, of digital hyper abstraction.</p><p id="""">This is the most toxic strain of the virus.</p><p id="""">It’s out there, moving faster than the human mind, in volumes we can no longer comprehend: complicated bets made with borrowed money by computer algorithms. Financial assets like derivatives and credit-default swaps — the same instruments that stole the show in the 2008 meltdown and provide much of the global economic muscle now — bundled together and hawked as the world’s best way to get rich. Speculations on speculations, hedges on hedges . . . these trillions coursing through the circulatory system of the world, this isn’t real money, or even the idea of money. It is the idea of the idea of the idea of money. A consensual hallucination that rips through every human being on the planet with untold brutality.</p><p id="""">The value of over-the-counter derivatives contracts now dwarfs the entire world’s GDP. Debt has lost all meaning. The US has no intention of ever paying back the $32-trillion it owes.</p><p id="""">A fundamental shift in the <em id="""">nature of value </em>has taken place right before our eyes.<br></p><p id="""">It didn’t have to be like this.</p><p id="""">What if we could walk this story back, as far as it takes, and then upend some key moments, so that a different story unfolds?</p><p id="""">Maybe the rewrite begins in 1095, but this time the Catholic Church <em id="""">thinks </em>about selling indulgences and then decides against it: <em id="""">No! </em>And so the next step never happens, the step of virtuous “gain” — the idea that justified pillaging and slavery and consuming more than you produce simply by raiding the Colonial pantry — never happens. That idea is stillborn. Indeed, the church doubles down on the other side and prohibits the hoarding of treasure on the backs of others. With that moral weight against it, usury never becomes the bedrock of global finance.</p><p id="""">And another world emerges.</p><p id="""">What would be different now? Would we still have derivatives?</p><p id="""">Flash trading? Predatory loans? Perpetual growth? Or might those artifacts of capitalist overreach have starved in the shade of more humane ideals?</p><p id="""">Maybe in this alternate universe our Western economic system retains a bit of the pure exchange ethic, worth for worth, the dignity and humanity of the exchangers intact. And maybe instead of a transactional system slowed at every turn by intermediaries reaching in to take their cut, we instead create a frictionless money system. Something a bit like the Islamic model.</p><p id="""">Islam never went the usury route. It never took the bait. Islam said: We will not allow money to be made off money, we will not allow the rich to become richer just because they are rich. And with that decision they steered clear of the worst of the class warfare we’re seeing now, the raging hatred that threatens to bring our whole Western house of cards crashing down.</p><p id="""">The point is, we had a choice.</p><p id="""">We still do.</p><p id="""">The way forward is to kill off flash-bot trading, outlaw derivatives and credit default swaps, curb Wall Street’s predatory appetites and flatten the money curve until the virus slowly dies.</p><p id="""">That is our charge.</p><p id="""">We start building towards frictionless money flows. We turn money into a public good, like highways. You can drive from New York to San Francisco without paying any tolls — so why can’t you send $100 to your mother in Lebanon without someone lopping $5 off the top?</p><p id="""">Cutting the middlemen completely out of the equation: that is the dream, that is our salvation. It’s a long shot, a wild card, an almost impossible strategy to implement any time soon.</p><p id="""">But as our current world system implodes along with our social and ecosystems, and market crashes start coming at us hard and fast, it might turn out to be the only viable financial play we have left in the planetary endgame.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/641e1caa198728702f2160b0_Global-financial-flows_600.gif,,"<p><strong id="""">— Excerpted from Adbusters’ forthcoming book.</strong></p><p id="""">Third Force</p>",I’ve never quite understood finance.

This is not a prophecy. It is a scientific certainty. So long as the city-sprawl keeps on crushing up against the forest’s edge, so long as extractive industry treads farther into the hotbeds of contagion that are the deepest wilds, so long as highways and airlines, supply chains and shipping routes link those hotbeds to more and more remote corners of the human-inhabited world — in short, so long as things go on as usual, there will be more disease, disruption, and death. What’s more, it will all strike with greater and less manageable frequency. There is little indication that medicine will be able to keep up. Barring nuclear annihilation or Earth-swallowing war, we’ll simply have to learn to live and die on a planet not only blistering with heat but festering with pestilence. So don’t be too quick to let go of that mask. The only alternative is to perish. </p><p id="""">The only alternative, that is, apart from a complete re-examination of the socioeconomic paradigm that has given rise to this state of affairs. But don’t get your hopes up. This is precisely what is called for in the case of the climate, and so far, it has proved too tall a task even (or rather <em id="""">especially</em>) for some of the most formidable concentrations of power and resources humanity has yet known. This is no coincidence. The kinds of ventures driving up the likelihood of further and fiercer pandemics are the very same that are pushing us nearer the cliff’s edge of environmental catastrophe. These are twin crises, in other words, with a common origin. They both spill forth from the same polluted spring, which we’ve been drinking from greedily for decades. </p><p id="""">First things first. Is a plague-ridden planet so unusual? After all, outbreaks of infectious disease are an age-old phenomenon. Everybody knows about the <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-Death"" id="""">Black Death</a>, for instance, and anyone who has read a sampling of nineteenth-century fiction will be familiar with the griminess of <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/cholera"" id="""">cholera</a> and the morbid glamour of “consumption.” Bacteria causing the latter, otherwise known as <a href=""https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"" id="""">tuberculosis</a> (TB), have in fact been found in the bodies of Egyptians mummified as far back as 4,400 years ago. In later years, <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox"" id="""">smallpox</a> and other contagions made their way across the Atlantic stowed away in the carcasses of European colonisers, wiping out up to <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-changed-after-europeans-killed-indigenous-americans-2019-2"" id="""">90 percent of the Americas’ Indigenous population</a> upon arrival. Smallpox was also the infection that spurred the development, in the late eighteenth century, of the <a href=""https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/05/23/anti-vax-resistance-immunity/"" id="""">first vaccine</a> (a word deriving from <a href=""https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-vaccine/"" id=""""><em id="""">variolae vaccinae</em></a>, or cowpox, controlled exposure to which was found to give immunity to the other pox). More recently, the Spanish flu of 1918 infected <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html"" id="""">a third of all humanity</a>, taking <a href=""https://www.history.com/news/world-war-i-1918-pandemic-memorials"" id="""">three times as many lives</a> as the First World War and doing the job in half the time. Death by disease, as history shows, is a well-practiced and timeworn tradition. </p><p id="""">For a time, however, it seemed this tradition might fade into disuse. The twentieth century saw life-saving leaps forward in hygiene, nutrition, and medicine. Following the discovery of penicillin in 1928, the development of antibiotics alone may have spared hundreds of millions a grisly demise by way of infection. Meanwhile, vaccination campaigns led to the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the suppression of countless deadly illnesses besides. Sanitation and other public-health measures did their part, altogether bringing about a dramatic stretching of the average human lifespan. In rich countries, at least, the declining proportion of deaths due to spreadable sickness spurred talk of an “epidemiological transition”: the dawning of an era in which more people succumb to non-communicable diseases (diseases of old age and bad habit) than to communicable ones. Soon enough, as Adam Tooze sums it up in <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/669575/shutdown-by-adam-tooze/"" id=""""><em id="""">Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World’s Economy</em></a><em id="""">, </em>catching a bug “would be consigned to the past.” To many expectant minds, contagiousness itself appeared poised to fall before the forward march of progress.<em id=""""> </em></p><p id="""">Yet this proved much too bright a forecast, and not just because it failed to account for most of the world beyond the wealthy North. Even as the promise of an epidemiological transition was catching on, new forms of biological violence were brewing in the depths of the jungle. Ebola may not actually liquify the insides of the infected, as luridly imagined by Richard Preston in his sensational bestseller <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/133843/the-hot-zone-by-richard-preston/"" id=""""><em id="""">The Hot Zone</em></a>. But as a “<a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/ebola/about-the-ebola-virus.html"" id="""">haemorrhagic fever virus</a>,” it can involve more than a bit of internal bleeding. First pinpointed in 1976, Ebola has been known to claim upwards of 50 percent (and as high as 90 percent) of its victims — though at <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326525/"" id="""">about 15,000</a> they are relatively few. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, is on another scale altogether. Since its identification in 1981, the defence-eroding pathogen has claimed <a href=""https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids"" id="""">more than 36 million lives</a>, 680,000 of them in 2020. Some 38 million live with HIV today. </p><p id="""">Though each chilling to contemplate, Ebola and HIV/AIDS are merely two swells at the front of a gathering storm. “Emerging infectious diseases” (fast-spreading, never-before-seen ailments as well as known ones popping up farther and farther afield) and “re-emerging infectious diseases” (those coming back from the brink) are among the biggest threats currently looming over our species. As many as three quarters of both emerging and re-emerging diseases owe their rise to incidents of “zoonotic spillover,” or the transference of pathogens from animals to humans. In fact, those able to make the beast-to-biped leap, called “zoonoses,” account for some 60 percent of all contagions ever to have infested humankind. Ebola is one. HIV is another. Further examples include bubonic plague, anthrax, rabies, typhus, cholera, influenza, SARS, MERS, West Nile, Zika — and yes, Covid-19. An epidemiological reading of history since the Second World War suggests that plagues of this kind are only cropping up thicker and faster. Before long, they may also start getting nastier. </p><p id="""">Yet what, exactly, are we humans doing to bring all this about? “Make no mistake,” David Quammen writes in <a href=""https://wwnorton.com/books/spillover/"" id=""""><em id="""">Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic</em></a>, published all the way back in 2012, “they are connected, these disease outbreaks coming one after another.” They are no flukes, no acts of God. Instead, they are better described as a retaliatory consequence of how we treat the Earth — a planetary immune response, if you will. “Human-caused ecological pressures and disruptions,” the manifestations of a reckless contempt for nature, are rousing deadly forces out of a deep-woods slumber. “Shake a tree,” that is, “and things fall out.” </p><p id="""">Shake many trees and an avalanche of vile things might rain down on your head, piñata-style. Deforestation (in the name of resource extraction, industrial farming, urban expansion, and the build-up of infrastructure) is a sure sign of capitalist investment, largely at the hands of modern-day colonial enterprises headquartered in the Global North and their collaborationist counterparts in the South. It is also a confirmed cause of spillover. Look no further than the rapidly denuded regions near the equator. Every year, an area of land roughly the size of Portugal <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation"" id="""">succumbs to deforestation</a> — 95 percent of it in the tropics, where thick seams of minerals, vast virginal woods, and ballooning conurbations can all be found in abundance. (The replacement of forest with beef-cattle pasture alone accounts for <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation"" id="""">over 40 percent of tropical tree-razing</a>, the bulk of it in Brazil.) In addition to a cornucopia of plunderable stuff, the equatorial zone boasts the greatest fount of biodiversity on the planet. Not unrelatedly, it’s also a matchless breeding ground for pathogens. </p><p id="""">You don’t have to be a virologist to grasp how, in trampling towards the heart of the jungle where illnesses thrive and multiply, humans might shake loose a scourge or two. Consider the following scenario. A blameless cattle farmer, with the help of generous <a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/brazilian-taxpayers-subsidizing-amazon-clearing-cattle-ranches-study-shows/#:~:text=One%20in%20every%2010%20pieces,credit%2C%20and%20even%20debt%20forgiveness."" id="""">taxpayer-funded subsidies</a>, claims a small patch of the Amazon for himself. He promptly begins the work of clearing the web of native trees and undergrowth, making room for his herd to graze. (Naturally, his stock is hopped up on a stiff cocktail of antibiotics, adding antimicrobial resistance to the list of potential causes of spillover.) Meanwhile a species of bat, displaced by the incursion, perches in the canopy bordering the farmer’s new plot. Due to their uniquely hospitable physiology, bats are what are called “reservoir species,” or disease carriers usually unharmed by their infectious cargo. But the stress caused by the destruction of its habitat has weakened the bat’s immune system, increasing the load of pathogens in its bodily fluids. A bat then drops its dung into the pasture, shedding a slurry of virulent waste precisely where the cattle feed. Having munched on contaminated fodder, the cattle get sick and serve as “amplifier hosts,” propagating an infection cast off by the reservoir species. After tending to the sickened herd, a farmhand goes home and passes it on to his friends and family. One of them, unwittingly harbouring the bug, travels to a nearby village for supplies, or sets off for a faraway jobsite, or boards a plane to visit relatives abroad. Out there, in the wider world, billions of warm bodies await. </p><p id="""">In pretty much this way, globalized networks of production, trade, and travel — instruments for shuttling Southern spoils to Northern markets — virtually ensure the far-flung circulation of a sufficiently contagious zoonotic disease. These systems can and do act as waiting vehicles for the instigation of epidemics — or, as in the now-familiar worst-case scenario, global pandemics. The speed of a given plague’s spread is limited only by its natural infectiousness and by our own capacities to detect and stop it. As recent events have shown, it would be wise not to put too much stock in the latter. </p><p id="""">Now, if you compare the drivers of climate change with the catalysts of spillover, it becomes clear they are far from distinct. They are one and the same. Despite surface appearances, neither extreme weather events nor world-stopping pandemics should be counted as sudden, one-off shocks. Both can be traced to underlying trends that are accelerating in terms of severity and scale. Both arise out of a way of life, and out of an economic system designed to maintain it, making not just gorillas and polar bears but <em id="""">ourselves </em>vulnerable to extinction. The threat of both, too, could be seen coming from some way off: no one can say the science didn’t try to warn us, the powers that be least of all. So here we are, caught in what appears to be a permanent battle waged on at least two simultaneous fronts — fronts that threaten to merge and engulf us all, starting with the least culpable. As Andreas Malm quotes of a concerned virologist in <a href=""https://www.versobooks.com/books/3704-corona-climate-chronic-emergency"" id=""""><em id="""">Corona, Climate, Chronic Emergency: War Communism in the Twenty-First Century</em></a>, “we are in an era now of chronic emergency.” </p><p id="""">It’s a bleak assessment. What, if anything, can be done to correct it? Nothing less than a total overhaul of the mass-industrial system of extraction and exploitation, production and plunder that makes up modern economic life. There’s simply no hope to be found in any approach relying on the invention of ever-more sophisticated technologies and medicines and other band-aids. We can’t beat nature at that kind of arms race for long, not while the root causes remain unaddressed. Though it may seem utopian to call for a radical re-evaluation of so entrenched a paradigm, such a call, as Andreas Malm puts it, is “exactly as utopian as survival.” We can’t afford to spend another day pretending otherwise. The earth beneath our feet is in revolt. The sky is clogged, the rivers are choking. The supply of food is becoming less and less reliable, and our politics that much more volatile. Our continuing retreat from the restorative fullness of nature into dim caverns of solitude can’t have nothing to do with the epidemic of mental illness tearing through the minds of the young, who face a daunting future to boot. Without mending our relationship to nature, to the living matrix of which we ourselves are an inseparable part, we will destroy the very thing that gives us life. We will be left to survive on the burnt remains of a charred planet, though for how long is anyone’s guess. Yet this is but the end of one path. We can still find it within ourselves to forge others. To do so, we must learn to overcome what Rosa Luxemburg called “a pestilential breath.” It is the smoggy sky as much as the contagious air. It is the poison in our water and in our minds. It isn’t some faraway, abstract thing.

We spoke at the end of September, when the temperature was still high; you could feel the summer breeze in the air and hear the drums of the Third Intifada, played by youth born in refugee camps. As international organizations like to put it, “security conditions were deteriorating” all around us thanks to decades of Israeli dispossession, violence, and occupation.</strong></p><p id="""">Khaled Hourani is a critical, peculiar institution. His prolific artistic practice encompasses painting, sculpture, writing, curating, and conceptual art, but he is also a part of the Palestinian collective body — crossing boundaries and limitations and constantly engaging in dialogue, the rule of art, and the possibilities of the present moment.</p><p id="""">Recently, I saw his work in the gallery of the Walled Off Hotel, in Bethlehem, before meeting him in Ramallah. As we talked, we were often joyfully interrupted by his dog Samra, who was simply showing off, and accompanied by the sharp but familiar sounds of the kitchen as his family prepared for dinner. Hourani often says <em id="""">yani</em> between sentences, which, as he explains, is Arabic for “means.” He laughs a lot, like one of those forever-young people who have seen and experienced a lot — and not always in the most favorable circumstances — but who still maintain the ability to ignite the spark of something new. We rolled cigarettes and sipped mint tea as our conversation drifted, in a cloud of smoke and steam, to the lofty heights of art and revolution.</p><p id="""">***</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Your work spans several decades and mediums — paintings, sculpture, conceptual art, writing, and curating. What has changed over time in your approach to art and issues around you?</strong>‍</p><p id="""">I work in different mediums, yani, with different concepts and issues from time to time. But I can tell you that during Covid, things changed. It was a unique time, with isolation, silence, being home, and social distancing — as if suddenly we had the luxury of having time to be at home and do art. Unfortunately, it was not like this; I was shocked like other people around me. This mandate to keep going, to continue doing what we were doing before, was not easy. I didn’t use this empty or quiet time to produce art. I quit being an artist for maybe a year while rethinking the rule of art.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I saw your latest work, part of a group exhibition at the gallery of the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem, last week. What prompted you to go back to painting?</strong></p><p id="""">I started walking as part of a local hiking group to change the atmosphere of being home all the time — to enjoy the landscape, mountains, and trees. But I figured out that even in such small actions, the wall and the politics are still there, even if you want to forget about it. Yani, wherever you go, you will see the wall, you will see the settlement. It gives the whole landscape a different meaning.</p><p id="""">At that time, I was taking photos during my hiking trip, thinking about the landscape, especially when it was morning or the golden hour in the sunset. It encouraged me to go back and do some paintings. I did a series of small works, a project called “Unnatural Landscape.” The work that you saw last week in Bethlehem is part of this. It started as a project about the landscape and the wall, and how this construction, this ugly concrete, yani, tries to cut, separate, and destroy the scene. What kind of effects does this wall have on the landscape, especially from a distance? I can see, when close to the wall, what kind of damage and social side-effects the wall has between the farmer and his land, the family and their relatives, between a city and a village. But also, from a distant view, for the one who wants to hike only, the landscape has a different meaning. We live in a high area here in Ramallah; when you look toward the sea, you can see different layers of mountains, but there is no empty landscape without settlement, without the wall.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Going back to one of your previous works titled “No Refuge,” where you dealt with the relation of the actual and the imaginary — the relation between art and reality — how do you see the role of art in this specific context, a context of “ugly concrete,” or to put it differently, in the context of the brutal reality that goes beyond what we could possibly imagine?</strong></p><p id="""">The relation between reality and fiction drove my thinking many times, and I keep coming back to this concept again and again. The line between reality and fiction has disappeared. It was never in our minds, my generation, that we would compete with news, since art cannot come up with such fiction.</p><p id="""">Regarding the Russian ambassador who was killed in Ankara in a gallery space — I did a huge painting about this, which was part of my retrospective in Jordan, in 2017. I chose this specific subject because the gallery space, or art in general, is considered a safe zone; yani, with everything going on outside, you go to the gallery, and you see the outcome or the result of what’s happening outside. It is something that talks about something else, it is representation. But in this act in the Ankara exhibition, when the ambassador himself was killed, the gallery was not a safe zone anymore. It is a declaration of action in gallery space. Art is not protected; there is no safe zone to run away from the catastrophe outside.</p><p id="""">We are in a competition between reality and art. Take, for example, the resistance — it is a kind of artistic action, because for a civilian to stop a tank or demonstrate against military police, they need imagination, and it looks like fiction. What encourages you to stand for something, to dream of having a different life, a better life? It’s a dream; it is fiction.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">That’s an interesting point, to look at civilians as artists of the resistance, not the other way around — artists as political activists.</strong></p><p id="""">I was always arguing that — I did lecture on this in Lebanon — the First Intifada was an artistic performance or artistic action. The uprising was not only political, as everyone tried to read it in decision-making circles, academic institutions, and the Western media in particular. It was culture par excellence, and deep to the extent that it was not possible to understand with the usual tools of political analysis. At that time, the Palestinian cause was in constant decline, the people were frustrated, and the national movement was eroding. So, at an unfavorable political moment, if politics is impotent and the national movement is in decline, then only culture and art are left as the main engines. Where realism ended, the impossible began.</p><p id="""">The uprising was like announcing a revolution not only against the occupation and its politics, but also against all its causes. People did not revolt only against the military machine and the barriers. They revolted against poor education and health care; they revolted to return to the land, and to home farming and solidarity; they revolted against the way of life that was denied them.</p><p id="""">The beginning revealed that this uprising had no leadership. On the contrary, the movement its protests came from the bottom up. I am talking about the beginning of an uprising that challenged art and surpassed it. The uprising is an artistic event, and people are artists until proven otherwise.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/645556a9dd739278e972a070_Picasso_in_palestine.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption id="""">Khaled Hourani, <em id="""">Picasso in Palestine #3 </em>(2019, oil on canvas)</figcaption></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You are fully recognized internationally. Your work has been exhibited in major galleries of contemporary art, and it is part of the collection of Western museums. Considering the political nature of your work, on one hand, and the fact that you come from occupied territory on the other, what was your position abroad, structurally speaking, as a Palestinian artist? Did you experience accusations of antisemitism — which happens quite frequently with Palestinian artists and intellectuals — or any sort of Western gaze toward your work?</strong></p><p id="""">Art in Palestine is not treated very well, for many reasons. Artists suffer; they get arrested, their work is destroyed, and some are not allowed to travel. I was allowed to travel, but I was arrested. I would like to be arrested for artistic reasons instead of political ones, but they do not consider you an artist; they consider you an activist if you do something encouraging or promoting a national issue. Our political issue is cultural-issue number one. No artist, no cultural institution can avoid this, even if they are not involved. But it is hard to think about art as separate from politics, anywhere. Art is sometimes more political than politics itself.</p><p id="""">There was a lot of solidarity at the beginning, during the Arafat times. In 1967 and in the 1970s, after the war, they wanted to treat Palestinians as victims, and they wanted to hug them, to give support. This is not a bad thing; this is a human reaction: otherwise, it would be a catastrophe. It doesn’t mean that there was no good art at that time. For me, I prefer to be treated as a human being, not as a victim first; I don’t like to think of myself as a victim, or to portray victims in my artwork. Art is not about complaining; it is about being critical. It is about seeing things from a different perspective. It’s about witnessing, about encouraging, about longing for a better life.</p><p id="""">So, when I was invited to Documenta 13 with the Picasso project, whether they liked Palestine or didn’t like Palestine, it was considered an art project that deals with the border between curating and art practice itself. Politics is there from the start; it would have no meaning to bring Picasso to some normal country, and it wouldn’t be my priority. Palestinian history, Palestinian issues, the checkpoint that the artwork has to come through, the image of policemen protecting an artwork — the Palestinian gunman-as-fighter, suddenly standing in front of a painting — this is what made the meaning, what made the project.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Yes, the famous “Picasso in Palestine” project. You wanted to bring one picture, one painting only, “Buste de Femme,” part of the collection of the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, to be exhibited in Ramallah. I am not sure that readers, many of whom will have seen Picasso regularly exhibited in their home countries, know what kind of speculative thinking and action was needed for this project to come to fruition. So, could you please elaborate the impossibilities that you were facing in bringing Picasso to Palestine? And how challenging was the whole process for you personally?</strong></p><p id="""">It was a very challenging project, a very risky project. The main question was, how to bring an artwork from a museum in Europe to be exhibited in a war zone? And then, how to convince the museum, since it must have the guarantee that the artwork will be in a safe van, in safe keeping — this was the first thing the insurance company asked for. We had to build a museum because, at that time, 2009 to 2011, we didn’t have a museum. And we needed money. So, it was kind of a miracle, and we had to work in fiction, too.</p><p id="""">I invited a filmmaker from the beginning, before I had even ten percent of the budget, to film all of this, even if we didn’t succeed. But there are artists, or people who believe in art, everywhere — this is also what the Picasso project taught me. For me, this was a learning process. I didn’t know how this would work, or if they were going to give me that amount of money, because it was a few hundred thousand dollars in question. And there was also a contention: Do we need such a thing in Palestine, with all the crisis at the time — and to bring only one Picasso painting? Is it really worth it?</p><p id="""">The artwork had to be protected 24 hours a day. We had to create a small museum according to strict criteria of humidity, temperature, security, lights, everything. People needed to go one-by-one to see it, or two-by-two, because it was a four-by-four-meter museum, and ten people breathing near it wouldn’t be healthy for the artwork itself. All these kinds of concerns.</p><p id="""">For me, it was a project about this small museum, an empty museum after the work was returned. We were also questioning the solidarity part of art action, because a lot of things could be considered solidarity activities, but this doesn’t look like it. And we were questioning, of course, the relation between museums in Europe and the rules about the Third World and war zones, areas of conflict.</p><p id="""">I was sure that it looked like a joke at the beginning, when I wrote a letter to a museum and said, “I want to officially borrow artwork from your collection and bring it to Ramallah, where we don’t have a state, we don’t have a museum — all these basic things — we don’t have an airport. We have nothing, but we want to try to satisfy all the criteria — except maybe the state.” [Laughs.]</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The project was a major success, not only internationally, in media and at Documenta 13; Palestinians also greeted it with much interest and excitement. What happened with this small museum after the exhibition of this one piece?</strong></p><p id="""">A German filmmaker, who was visiting the [International Academy of Art Palestine; see below] and the museum a few months after the painting went back to the Netherlands, asked the same question. He was sitting in this empty room and asking what I was going to do with it, as if I had to do something as an artist, as if I had to do a new project. Your question now invites me to think more as an artist. Because in my way of thinking, doing a new art project is a kind of declaration, as if what I did is not enough, as if I need to do something, as if there is the necessity of saying something new. Why do more than one project?</p><p id="""">We still have visitors; they want to take photos in that room and its empty square, where the painting hung. You have the same story in art history, like what happened with Mona Lisa; the disappearance of artwork is a concept in itself. If I want to do it again, it will come across like gossip —that is, when you say something extra that’s not needed. I think the empty space itself is something. But I am very satisfied with the kind of art that is coming up around the Picasso project. There was a comic book by American- German artist Michael Baers; he did “An Oral History of Picasso in Palestine,” he did a huge book, seven-hundred-and-something pages of drawings; I will show you …</p><p id="""">What Michael did — research, being involved, visiting, interviewing, and drawing — he is still involved today. The thing is, he knows more about the project than I do.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The small museum was located inside the International Academy of Art Palestine, where you served first as Artistic Director and then as General Director from 2007 to 2013. What kind of institution was the Academy?</strong></p><p id="""">It was like an art project, a very experimental kind of institution. We had an agreement between our Academy and Oslo Art Academy, so students who wanted to study here knew from the beginning that we were not looking to have accreditation from the Palestinian Authority because we were critical of their accreditation criteria. If you want to follow in their steps, you can go to a regular university. If your passion is art, however, you are welcome.</p><p id="""">At the time, there were adventurous artists who were unknown. In insurance companies, you will find artists; in police stations, you will also find crazy people who believe in art and artists. This is the magic that bring things together — brings crazy people, crazy teachers, and crazy students together.</p><p id="""">The Academy has influenced the Palestinian art scene very deeply. It was a bridge between the old generation, their experience, and the new generation; it showed the needs of both generations to negotiate the terms of art, life, and the role of art. It was an open institution, even for non-students; we did a lot of tours, a lot of open lectures, and we invited people from everywhere. It was not about the classic way of teaching. It was an alternative.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It seems that you were, at the time of your engagement with Academy, already a bit disillusioned with previous experience in the Ministry of Culture. I also worked for the Ministry of Culture in Croatia, having a dream of a different kind of state and a united front within the scene we represented there. Needless to say, these dreams crashed rather abruptly in the course of everyday politics. What was your experience? Were you the general director of the Fine Arts department?</strong></p><p id="""">Working for the Ministry of Culture was like fiction. [Laughter.]</p><p id="""">I was the general director of the Fine Arts department. It is a very big name for a small department. In the beginning, the Palestinian National Authority was the [Palestine Liberation Organization] institution, and the PLO was a revolutionary kind of institution; we were proud to be part of this institution, but it became old and corrupt very quickly. They were not into content, but rather institution-building itself. It attracted all kinds of artists, not only visual — a lot of musicians and writers got involved, too.</p><p id="""">The PLO had a state kind of structure, and it started all these departments — literature, visual arts, cinema, dancing, and theatre, each art had its own department. I was invited to work there, in the Ministry of Culture, though I didn’t apply myself. These were dreamy times, and I did many things that I am proud of — a lot of international workshops and biennales. But I figured out that art has its own life away from this government institution, and that art has to think about how to see this government from a critical point of view, too.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/645557067df9d0512ab80d06_Khaled-1-scaled.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption id="""">Khaled Hourani, <em id="""">Hasan</em>, <em id="""">Zeina</em>, <em id="""">Rakan</em> (2020, Acrylic on canvas)</figcaption></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Throughout your life, you invested yourself not only in your artwork but also in what we could call institutional design. I am referring not only to the Academy and the Ministry of Culture, but to initiating or being present in other artistic and cultural initiatives, supporting younger artists, and building a scene.</strong></p><p id="""">I see institutions as artistic things, as models. For me, the Academy was a model, a new model that doesn’t look like teaching art in a government college or a university that has accreditation from the government. It is kind of parallel or alternative. For example, to do a project like “Picasso in Palestine” would not be possible as an individual artist; it needs institutional involvement, which the artist cannot guarantee, no matter who the artist is. I believe the artist is an institution that is sometimes more important than the institution itself. But sometimes, you have to create an institution. However, it has to be flexible enough. For example, in the Picasso project, there were a hundred individuals and institutions involved; it was not only the artist. A lot of issues needed to be solved, including media, taxes, security, insurance, and technical criteria. Palestinian guards — they don’t have experience in dealing with artwork or convincing the Ministry of the Interior that this artwork needs to be protected 24 hours a day. There were many people working, and the last one working was the artist. I was here, and sometimes I got stuck and didn’t have a solution for things. But there was a group and group mechanism, and together we found a solution.</p><p id="""">For example, between the <em id="""">Qalandia</em> checkpoint and the Palestinian checkpoint, there is a no man’s land, a grey area. There is no possibility for Palestinian police to go there. Israelis are not allowed to go either, except by force, and then there will be demonstrations and tear gas. So, there are a few kilometers between the checkpoint and the Palestinian police. How to convince the insurance company that it is OK there will be no security guards in this specific area? I tried with the Palestinian government and asked them if they could go and talk with the Israelis only for this operation, but the Israelis refused. I couldn’t ask them to have Israelis come …</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How did you resolve it?</strong></p><p id="""">Through the media. My assistant came up with this brilliant idea that she would write to the museum and the insurance company to invite the cameramen from Al Jazeera and CNN; it would be protected by cameras instead of machine guns. It was live on Al Jazeera. Who would kidnap artwork in such circumstances?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What are the main challenges for the contemporary Palestinian art scene, especially for the younger generation? Is there any official state support for artists these days in Palestine?</strong></p><p id="""">Art is in a very critical moment everywhere, yani, but good artwork will find its own way to exist. You can do a great project for zero budget. Some projects need fundraising and money to exist, but this is the magical thing: some don’t. Artists need to invest in their passion and creativity. If you have a great idea, it will convince others, and money will come. </p><p id="""">I am not sure if the government or other official institutions are interested in what contemporary artists or young artists are doing, because it is also very critical work. They will not like what they produce, so they will never support them. And independent art institutions, NGO institutions, are worse than a government; they have their own censorship.</p><p id="""">There are two big institutions in Palestine, bigger than the Ministry of Culture. The Qattan Foundation and the Palestinian Museum have a big budget and nice buildings; but for a while, they only work on certain topics, strange topics. They only want to work on the past and memory or the future, nothing about the present moment. They are ignoring what’s going on now. They talk about Palestinian life next to the sea, before 1948, which is good; but I am not sure this is a necessity now. When they invite you, they invite you to work on this or that concept, topic or theme. They don’t ask you as an artist, “What you are doing?” and then invite you to come and work with them. They tell you, “We are thinking about doing this exhibition about this book published in the ’80s — what’s your contribution?” That’s not my cup of tea.</p><p id="""">They create their own themes, and even with this concern about the worries of the young generation, they are not actually worried about what they think. They invite them to ignore their issues and their life and to think according to their agenda. And their main issue is to keep going; their function is not art. They are employees in this machine called an institution. The artist is not about the institution; his or her concern is about art and the space for freedom.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Palestine was, at least in the PLO period, considered a secular Arab country. There is a growing concern in recent times of <em id="""">re-traditionalization</em>, especially along religious lines, that also affects art.</strong></p><p id="""">To be honest, art was attacked by two governments. By Hamas, because of its beliefs — it thinks art encourages people to use their imagination, that it encourages both genders to get together, especially dancing and theatre, and encourages people to think outside the box. You know what culture does. They like a kind of art and culture that is more conservative. They don’t mind if you shout out against the occupation — but don’t talk about your freedom, don’t sing about your own life.</p><p id="""">But the Palestinian Authority and the Ministry of Culture in the West Bank recently started to become very conservative, too. There was a march for the theater a few months ago, and it was attacked by some conservatives because it looked like a gay demonstration — which it wasn’t, but even if it was … They were attacked, and the police were not protecting artists; they tried to be neutral.</p><p id="""">This was not the case before. I wrote in a post, “As if there is no art in Palestine in such a situation — in Gaza or here.” It is a very bad sign, and it was never like this before, the Palestinian Authority letting conservatives — I am not sure who was behind this, but it was clear they let things happen. They didn’t protect artists or theater. And this was not the only case. There were other shows, concerts, and events that were canceled. For me, this is censorship. The government likes conservative, nationalist work, supportive of their cause, but not the kind of work raising questions. Because people are critical of authority now, unlike before.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">You’ve had the opportunity to travel, and I am guessing that you’ve also had opportunities to leave Palestine. Given the circumstances and what the so-called international community calls “deteriorating security conditions,” did you ever think about leaving Palestine?</strong></p><p id="""">Now, yes; before, no. There is less hope now than before. There was an article in the newspaper recently asking, “If not a two-state solution, then what?” I was thinking about my son, the future of his generation, who will not suffer from the same issues we are suffering from. But the thing is, we start counting from zero, and things are worse than before. The Palestinian national movement, the PLO, is defeated now. We should face the fact that this project has collapsed. I don’t think they will manage to succeed.</p><p id="""">In the future, the occupation has to come to an end, for sure. But the element that made Palestinians stand for their rights historically was Arab support, international support, and unity between the leadership and the people. All these elements are nonexistent now.</p><p id="""">And yet there is nowhere to go. Where else to go? Now, is it better here or there?</p><p id="""">***</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">After our interview, Hourani and his family tried to call a taxi for me, but I convinced them I could easily reach East Jerusalem — also in occupied territory — by myself. I caught the last bus from Ramallah and soon arrived at the infamous <em id="""">Qalandia</em> checkpoint, the same checkpoint that Picasso’s “Buste de Femme” once passed through. At Qalandia, I was met with full-fledged drama, flashing red lights revealing soldiers in full military gear.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">It really is like fiction — to me, at least.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Soldiers conducted a search both within and around the bus. Meanwhile, police dogs sniffed frantically to see if there were any terrorists about, ready to destroy it all. The multitude of weapons hanging from the soldiers’ bodies almost knocked against us passengers, none of whom seemed seriously afraid — nor was I, in the end. It was clear that this was a common situation. After all, this must happen to them every single day: they set off somewhere on this tiny piece of land, and then encounter any number of checkpoints and barriers along the way, in the end getting nowhere.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">After a two hours’ wait, the bus was allowed to move on — but backward instead of forward. Some kids from the bus led me away, almost by hand, telling me we could still cross the checkpoint on foot. A young Israeli female soldier yelled at me relentlessly; I answered all her questions and finally passed through.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">I was relieved to see several buses parked on the other side. Displaying an instinctual Croat–Arab understanding, the bus driver assured me that everything was OK, that he would take me almost to my doorstep. “Are you from Modrić country?” he asked me, referring to the world-renown footballer. I smile — then and now, while writing this all down — thinking that art can’t be dead yet, at least not in this part of the world.

These paths aren’t straight. They go where they go. They’re created by no one’s executive decision. Instead, they arise one choice at a time.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Urban planners call these DIY routes “desire lines.” Or sometimes “pirate paths.”</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Anarchy isn’t about taking a sledgehammer to the sidewalks the state builds for you.

It’s neoclassical economics that’s the dinosaur. It’s rational self-interest that you grow out of – along with bongs, giant woofers and Ayn Rand.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Anarchism is “mutual support, mutual aid, and mutual defense.” So said Peter Kropotkin, zoologist and philosopher. He spent five years in Siberia making field notes, like Darwin in the Galapagos. He noticed there was another story going on, parallel to the dog-eat-dog business that capitalism adopted as its master narrative.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">“Sociability is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle.” Organisms tend to live longer when they co-operate. It’s just as much in us to care as to kill. Once you really grok that, it’s hard to dismiss co-operation as a strategy worth trying. The only thing that stops us is our own cynicism.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">If you really want to understand anarchism, look at a little kid</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">“Every society needs a barefoot Socrates to keep it honest,” says Gareth Matthews. That tiny philosopher was you and me, once. All children are anarchists — asking rude questions and speaking truth to power and using the wrong fork. And sometimes frying ants on the sidewalk with a magnifying glass, because life’s an ongoing experiment with no interference from the ethics board. But then, bit by bit, that kick-the-tires spirit gets knocked out of us. We grow into adults, losing much of our spontaneous and authentic selves along the way.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">And then we spend the rest of our lives trying to get it back.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Anarchism keeps popping up everywhere</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">When George Orwell landed in Barcelona in December of 1936, he found the city in the grip of something totally new. The Catalonian revolutionaries had gained control and a transformation was happening. Factories and farms were being run by workers’ collectives. The red-and-black flags of the anarchists hung from the bigger buildings.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Orwell didn’t know what the city had felt like before but he described what it felt like now.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">“Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said ‘Señor’ or ‘Don’ or even ‘Usted’; everyone called everyone else ‘Comrade’ or ‘Thou’, and said ‘Salud!’ instead of ‘Buenos días’….</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">“Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.”</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Not everything about this was commendable, and the experiment was over by the spring of ‘39 when Franco won the war. But enough of a glimpse of an alternative was revealed here, of another way to be, that the feeling was held and carried and tended, like a little ember, to be revived on the streets of Paris in May of 1968.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">There, starting on the Left Bank and rolling outward in waves, life became art. People broke from their routines and did risky, wild things. The Situationists channeled the spirit of anarchy into a kind of lifestyle. There should be switches on street lamps, they said, so lighting would be under public control. And maybe we level some churches to create places for children to play. They promoted a “life of permanent novelty” — a world of pleasure to win and “nothing to lose but boredom.”</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">The extremes of the human psyche, the highs and the lows: that is anarchy. But it means you get the whole package, from euphoria to fury. We get pissed off: that’s part of the deal of being human. Sometimes you simply have to make “necessary trouble,” as John Lewis put it. Sometimes it’s the only way to get unjust laws overturned.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">And sometimes things become an unholy mess.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">In Portland, police didn’t exactly know who they were dealing with in the black bloc as the race riots turned parts of downtown into a war zone. Who was under those balaclavas? Could have been an antifa. Could have been one of the wrongway antifas who smashed the windows of mostly blackowned businesses along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and toppled the statue of Lincoln. It probably wasn’t one of the intellectual lefties, Proudhon in their backpacks, who’d gathered in Peninsula Park (“Come for the anarchism, stay for the soup”).</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Anarchy is a big tent, and no one’s checking ID at the door.

An irreversible extinction event is about to drop – literally. A meteorite is on a collision course for earth, and earthlings can’t get their shit together to deal with it or even acknowledge it in any productive way. (The plan of a few people to get rich from its rare minerals doesn’t count because it’ll be a lavish, short-lived party.)<br></p><p><em>Don’t Look Up!, </em>the movie that caught the zeitgeist over the long Omicron winter, is all about denial. More than that, it’s about what cognitive sociologist Evia Zerubavel calls “meta-denial”: denial hiding even from itself. As in: <em>No one is talking about the fact that no one is talking about this. </em>But now they are, thanks to this film. That’s a good thing. There are still some elements of the movie that rankle, and I’ll get to them in a sec.</p><p>The smartest thing about the film is that it involves a meteor and not some climate-related storm. So you can <em>choose </em>to see it as a metaphor for global warming at 100x speed. But the meteor can also stand in for everything from Trump’s Big Lie to the effectiveness of vaccinations. One denial fits all.</p><p>Denial is the brain’s bombproof defense mechanism. It kicks in when a truth is too big and scary to face. Often it’s a frog-in-a-pot situation: we can tell ourselves that everything is just fine, even as the alarm bells grow loud enough to make our eardrums bleed.</p><p>So we have grotesqueries like a Federal Reserve that can’t put the brakes on trillions of dollars of <em>quantitative easing </em>because Wall Street throws a tantrum every time it tries. We have surveillance capitalism galloping out of control because it came under cover of darkness (and by dawn we were in too deep). We have corporations running amuck, getting away with murder and even crimes against humanity, while We the People acquiesce. Meanwhile, the Pentagon and CIA keep killing innocent people in botched drone attacks without much pushback. </p><p>It takes enormous energy and alertness to monitor how much we have drifted from baseline, and almost nobody is up to this kind of vigilance. No matter how insane things get, we accept it all as the new normal as long as everybody else does. </p><p>Freud explained denial as simply repressing the unseemly stuff in order to sail blithely over the surface of our daily lives. </p><p>But the shit’s on the table now. So what to do? The denialist move is to say: <em>I don’t accept it. I am free to not accept it. I don’t trust the experts you trot out to tell me I’m wrong. </em></p><p>I refuse to accept the outcome of the most secure democratic election in American history. </p><p>A third of Americans can’t face the fact that their guy lost: that is the most blatant example of mass denial I’ve ever encountered. I was sure the fog would roll back out and America would come to its senses. But no. The madness just keeps escalating. </p><p>The pushback — just like the resistance against social-justice movements — is also a kind of <em>strategic </em>denial. To acknowledge the truth would cost you too much in the wallet, or in power, or in the spoils your privilege has allowed you to pile up. So it’s fingers-in-the-ears la-la-la … If the truth can’t get in, I don’t have to change the way I live or think. It’s all good. And it’ll be even better after we trounce the socialists in the midterms! </p><p>For bonus chutzpah points, you can put your denial on display. In the US Supreme court, all nine justices wear masks but one. That would be Neil Gorsuch. He proudly sits naked-faced in the chamber, forcing Sonia Sotomayer, who is immunocompromised, to work from home.<br></p><p>You could say that most of us are in denial about most things most of the time — and that’s simply nature’s way of getting us through the day. What we perceive is the tiny tip of the iceberg of what is actually going on. The full firehose spectrum of incoming information gets run through the tiny funnel of what we can usefully process. We’re not perceiving “reality” at all. If we could, it would be far more absurd and incomprehensible than anything Dali or Gogol ever dreamed up.</p><p>If we fully tuned into the suffering we know is happening in the world, we’d be overwhelmed and paralyzed. So we quite willingly turn away.</p><p>In his book <em>States of Denial, </em>the Johannesburg-born sociologist Stanley Cohen picked apart the massive denial around the apartheid system he grew up in. White South Africans practically twisted into contortions not to see the atrocities and suffering right before their eyes. They simply could not acknowledge it — because that would mean having to revise the story of who they thought they were. “What do we do with our knowledge of the suffering of others?” Cohen asks. “<em>And what does this knowledge do to us</em>?”</p><p>The drumbeat becomes: <em>I can live with this</em>. Even if, on some level, you know you can’t.</p><p>In a time of crisis, we count on our A-team of artists to rise up and meet the moment . . . and my first reaction was, <em>Is this really the best we can do?</em></p><p>“It’s a comedy!” my Gen Z friend insisted when I admitted it was unsettling me. “It’s entertainment. Don’t overthink it.”</p><p>But I wish we could muster a feistier cultural response than cheap laughs. “It’s like <em>Dr. Strangelove!” </em>everyone said. But actually: no. That film had another register. It made you laugh, but it also summoned a primordial rage. That hot state is apparently above the paygrade of most of Westerners in the year 2022: we just won’t go there. And that too is a kind of denial — a “soft denial,” as the writer Jenny Offil put it recently. It’s the cop-out of, as she puts it, “thinking it but not feeling it.”<br></p><p>That is the coward’s response to crisis. </p><p>But it’s been America’s reflex since it started getting outcompeted in just about every area it thought was its jam. “Americans will wake up one day and realize that China has done to the US what the US did to the UK in the 20th century,” the novelist Tim O’Brien said recently. America countered its loss of supremacy by puffing out its chest and screaming MAGA, convincing no one. </p><p>The idea that America could simply be <em>done </em>— as top dog, or even a functioning democracy — will strike many as such an impossibility that they simply cannot take it in. Just as in the old canard, when Magellan’s ships supposedly sailed past Patagonia and the Indigenous people simply could not comprehend what they were seeing. These objects were so large and strange and foreboding that, fictitiously, they simply <em>did not register, </em>except as the shadow of gods, and the people apparently folded them into their mythology, to cloud their dreams and steer their fate. </p><p>This is how great nations die. </p><p>Sure, there are still bursts of individual genius, but the way America as a whole is responding to crisis is pretty much <em>the opposite of genius. </em>Witness the total inability to show the way forward, the lack of courage, the lack of effectiveness, the cultlike denial of truth. And the appalling lack of compassion for the million people who died of an all-too-real virus. </p><p>The elephant in the room is that the American story is simply not working. Not any more. A once-daring experiment has gone astray. Now the only script left is a redemption script. </p><p>So we wait for one of two things to happen: Either an FDR-like super-Obama rises up and galvanizes people into a life-saving pivot. Or else something new starts brewing in the heartland. An impulse to tinker with the fundamentals, to burrow down into the guts of what’s wrong with America. </p><p>Why don’t we face the toxic stuff head-on: The unbearable arrogance of corporate CEOs. The boneheaded stubbornness of logic-freak economists. The insufferable decadence of the 1%. The insanity of a marketplace that tells a lie with every purchase. The psychic fallout of a communications system that commodifies every thought and feeling. The madness of a “defense” strategy that depends on wars without end.</p><p>And then you let the existential weight of all that madness sink into your bones, until the soft denial falls away and you go, Holy shit, we’ve got to do something, <em>I’ve </em>got to do something, whatever it takes. Even if it means revising the story of who I think I am.</p><p>There’s a moment in <em>Don’t Look Up! </em>when the president challenges the physicist’s assertion that the extinction event is a dead-to-nuts certainty. “Please don’t say a hundred percent.” “Well,” he says, “it’s 99.78 percent.” “Great!” she says, “so it’s not 100 percent.” In a way, the most conniving character in the movie just made the one hopeful dodge. We still have a scrapper’s chance here. It’s going to take looking squarely at all the things we’ve allowed to curdle so badly, and then committing to do whatever it takes to fix things.</p><p>If that happens a counter-narrative will take hold — one strong enough to mow down the established idiocies if enough folks buy in. And this counter-narrative says there <em>is </em>a way to walk back these mistakes. There <em>are </em>solutions to these things we don’t want – and they involve concrete (if challenging) mass actions, like revoking the charters of criminal corporations, and getting a party elected that will push for true-cost markets, and pressing for new rules requiring a raw majority’s approval before any war can begin.</p><p>The way out of our denial is a <em>metameme insurrection. </em>I know in my guts this can work. When the alternatives are doing nothing and going under, or accepting the totalitarian future that China is offering, what have we got to lose?</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/62855e1621313e1d2c97a33f_vr_meta_denial_600.jpg,,<p>- <strong>Kalle Lasn</strong></p>,"You know the story.

It also apparently used to be more fun. There was an anarchist house, a lake where students hosted bonfires and lascivious costume parties.In “Stanford’s War on Social Life,” in Palladium magazine, Ginevra Davis argues that an army of administrators has systematically shut that down.</em>‍<em id="""">She writes: “Since 2013, Stanford’s administration has executed a top-to-bottom destruction of student social life. Driven by a fear of uncontrollable student spontaneity and a desire to enforce equity on campus, a growing administrative bureaucracy has destroyed almost all of Stanford’s distinctive student culture.”</em>‍<em id="""">Theme houses and fraternities have been shutdown, weird rituals banned. Outdoor house, for students who enjoy hiking and the like, was removed from campus, though it was given permission to reopen this year after shifting its mission to “racial and environmental justice in the outdoors.”</em>‍<em id="""">The old culture gave students agency to be creative and have fun. But, Davis observes, “In less than a decade, Stanford’s administration eviscerated100 years of undergraduate culture and social groups. They ended decades-old traditions. They drove student groups out of their houses. They scraped names off buildings. They went after long-established hubs of student life, like fraternities and cultural theme houses. In place of it all,Stanford erected a homogeneous housing system that sorts new students into perfectly equitable groups named with letters and numbers. All social distinction is gone.”</em>‍</p><p id="""">‍<em id="""">— Excerpted from David Brooks, New York Times</em></p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image

I was two years old when Red Army busted through the Leningrad Blockade and marched in.</p><p>The Russians were hardly liberators. They were almost worse than the Nazis. They’d culled the population of Estonia to a million people, and who knows what fate my family would have met had we not fled on one of the last boats out.</p><p>My earliest memory is the raw, dank smell of the earth. I was huddled in the dark next to my mother in a root cellar in the west of Germany, surrounded by sacks of potatoes, while sirens blared above.</p><p>We ended up in a series of displaced-persons camps. Food was scarce. Some weekends we walked deep into the German countryside to barter with farmers. Once my mother exchanged her precious fur coat for a bag of eggs and vegetables.</p><p>My father got a part-time job at the UN Relief organization UNRRA — and to the great joy of the whole family he would sometimes bring home a can of Spam, baked beans, a jar of strawberry jam.</p><p>As the repatriation efforts began, I remember a tall American soldier with a disarming aw-shucks smile scooping me up and pressing a Hershey bar into my hand.</p><p>I spent the next five years in and out of those refugee camps – till age seven. And then another five years in refugee camps in Australia.</p><p>I basically spent my entire childhood in a bubble.</p><p>We’d been kicked out of our own country by the Communists, leaving everything behind. So anything that smelled of collectivism was anathema to my father.</p><p>“Those commie bastards . . .” he would mutter.</p><p>I pretended to sleep but listened intently to the drunken late-night banter of Estonian expats . . . “I’d like to line those fucking commies up against a wall and mow them down one by one . . .”</p><p>One night they argued about a book called The Decline of the West by Oswald Spengler. The notion that Western civilization was decaying and may soon die off was too big, too scary for me to engage with. But this idea has been stuck in my mind ever since.</p><p>My father was a tennis champion. His actual job was as a lawyer for the Estonian government, but who he was, was an athlete – and something of a national hero. Before WWII started, he was the singles tennis champion of all the Balkans. He captained Estonia’s Davis Cup team, and played Wimbledon. But he could never beat Sweden’s Kalle Schröder. That’s why I think he named me after him.</p><p>‍</p><h2>INITIATION</h2><p>When I stepped onto campus at the University of Adelaide, I don’t think I had a political bone in my body.</p><p>I noticed two types of students running around. The beer-drinking righties with their Bertrand Russell, A.J. Ayer and Gilbert Ryle, more British than the British.</p><p>And then there were the Gauloise-smoking, coffee-sipping Lefties, with their Kierkegaard, their Nietzsche, their Sartre and Camus. I wondered: Which side am I on?</p><p>I studied pure and applied mathematics because my parents with their refugee mentality urged me to study the sciences so I could make a “decent” living. But my heart was in philosophy.</p><p>The philosophy department was firmly in the British “logical positivist” camp. Every word, every sentence, every thought had to be rigorously scrutinized for logical purity — all religious and metaphysical nuances lopped off by Occam’s razor.</p><p>Wading through Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus I found a few gems: “What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.” In his Cambridge lectures he would often bury his head in his hands and mutter, “I am a fool … I am a fool.” At least that was the story.</p><p>Later I read his <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. The hard dogmatism of his Tractatus gave way here to something softer, more forgiving. A few of his aphorisms had a mystical ring to them. Wittgenstein fought for Austria in WWI. The first time he glimpsed the Russian enemy, he wrote in his diary, “Now I have the chance to be a decent human being, for I’m standing eye to eye with death.”</p><p>That quote has stuck with me. Maybe because it carried a message that something more than logic has to be at stake in life.</p><p>Wittgenstein’s last words on his deathbed were “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.”</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/60806ccbdac14753d1a5d529_Ludwig_Wittgenstein_600x450.gif"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption><a href=""https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/03/05/wittgenstein-schoolteacher/"">Ludwig Wittgenstein.</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>A friend introduced me to classical music. His love for Berlioz, Bach and Beethoven bordered on the obsessive, and some of it rubbed off on me. I joined a record club, and once a month when the disc arrived, I’d put my head close to the gramophone late at night. The dark tones of Sibelius. The sublime quiet movement of Beethoven’s 9th. The triumphant cannon blasts in Tchaikovsky’s 1812 overture. And later in life, the dissonant forebodings of Bruckner and Mahler.</p><p>In my final year, someone passed me a copy of <em>The Outsider</em> by Colin Wilson, one of Britain’s so-called “angry young men.”</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>The philosophy I’d been reading had been rarefied and narrow, tiny plots of land tended by high-minded intellectuals. This was different. Here was this guy hoeing into life like it was a barroom brawl.</p><p><em>The Outsider</em> was a kind of grand, unifying theory of the fully alive Western man – a spiritual and cognitive quester, a freelance warrior soul.</p><p>You could learn a lot, Wilson was saying, from the intrepid scouts who had gone to the edge and reported back. Kafka. Nietzsche. Camus. T.E. Lawrence. Dostoyevsky. Nijinski. Van Gogh. What these artists were chasing was <em>intensity</em> — a rare thing in a culture that seemed frightened of such animal impulses. All of them had experienced what Wilson called “moments of vision.” Some of them were a little bit nuts. But they saw further, vibrated faster, sucked the stars out of the sky. They were misfits not because there was anything wrong with them, but because there was something very, very wrong with society.</p><p>So <em>this</em> is what revolutionary fervor looks like.</p><p><em>The Outsider</em> was written like the author thought he was going to be shot at dawn. I ripped through it. It was ecstatic. It promised deliverance to a higher plane of being. The idea was that you could catch lightning in a bottle if you just had the guts to stand out there in the thunderstorm, with an open heart.</p><p>Wilson’s brand of existentialism was a different beast.

After a long bull session in somebody’s room, drinking beer, getting high on something, a few of us ended up in a loft in the warehouse district.</p><p>The tenant was a rawboned guy with long messy hair and a beatnik beard. On his wall, a smash of posters, newspaper tear-outs, scribbled musings. Behind his bed a stolen traffic sign that said <em>DETOUR</em>.</p><p>He was a poet, people said. He held strong opinions about everything and spoke with dramatic force. He had ten years on me, easily. He’d gone through what I was going through now and punched through to the other side, into a wild, free life.</p><p>This guy’s whole existence said: You can rebel.</p><p>I was absolutely taken by him. I wanted to be like him.</p><p>I never saw him again.</p><p>*</p><p>Australia was a culture shock in the opposite direction — more chloroform than caffeine. Did we really need to talk about Aussie-rules football on the tele all the time? Plus Australia was just too far away from the rest of the world. A racy book by Mary McCarthy called <em>The Group</em> was a best seller in America at the time, but you couldn’t get it in Oz; it was banned for “offending the public morals.” I remember thinking: What the fuck is wrong with this place?</p><p>‍</p><h2>MUSE</h2><p>The Australian government paid my way through university, and in exchange I gave them three years of my life. I played war games for the Department of Defence. As soon as my contract was up, I hopped on a boat heading for Amsterdam.</p><p>But the boat made a stop in Yokohama. There, unfolding all around were the mysteries of a culture that turned everything I believed inside out. I was entranced. Three days later the boat left for Amsterdam. I wasn’t on it.</p><p>I got a job with a consulting company, and soon after starting my own marketing firm, grandiosely called International Computer Research (ICR), in Tokyo’s Roppongi district.

His masterpieces were <em>Tokyo Story</em> and <em>Equinox Flower</em>. His subject was family life, and the camera was always placed low down in the sitting position. On the surface not much happens. In <em>Tokyo Story</em> there’s a scene of an old couple, who have come from the country, sitting on a park bench in the sunlight. They don’t speak. Nothing happens. The scene lingers for what feels like forever. It is incredibly profound.</p><p>In the bars, night after night, I met disillusioned American GIs on R &amp; R leave from the Vietnam War. They told me stories of the hell that was being loosed over there. Many of them went AWOL, hiding in their girlfriends’ apartments until the military police tracked them down and dragged them back to their units.</p><p>Then I got wind of another uprising. It had started in Paris’ Latin Quarter and quickly spread around the world.</p><p>The English-language <em>Japan Times</em> reported that angry young men and women were rising up against consumer capitalism. Students, artists, nurses, doctors, bus drivers. They occupied campuses and factories and hospitals, singing songs, issuing manifestos. All over Paris they sprayed slogans like <em>Live Without Dead Time</em> and <em>Under the cobblestones, the beach!</em></p><p>Through the speakers of GI radio came a siren call out of Haight-Ashbury. Otis Redding had a pretty good view of things from the dock of the bay. “If You’re Going to San Francisco,” Wear Some Flowers in Your Hair. That lifted my spirits every time I heard it. The spirit of ’68. </p><p>It was time to see what it was all about.</p><p>‍</p><h2>EROS</h2><p>“Feed your head,” Jefferson Airplane sang.</p><p>Grace Slick would later say that song (“White Rabbit”) was inspired by Miles Davis’s <em>Sketches in Spain</em>.

It dissolved boundaries between individual people and between people and the world. It made us all truly <em>get</em> the idea of the collective.

We felt that a lot of things were broken, and we could help bring the fix. We’d take this old world that our stuffy parents believed in, and shake some passion, compassion and camaraderie into it.</p><p>Set it free.</p><p>*</p><p>There are moments in history “when millions of people surge into the streets and refuse to leave until real shifts are made in the social order. These moments accomplish in days what takes history years or even decades.”</p><p>The American historian George Katsiaficas called it The Eros Effect.</p><p>In a blink there is a total values shift. “Instead of patriotism, hierarchy or competition being the dominant values, people construct new values of solidarity, humanity, of love for each other.”</p><p>Mainstream sociologists consider these cultural heaves a kind of mass hysteria, bursts of madness. And yet, as Katsiaficas put it, “when we look at them from the bottom, from the perspective of ordinary people, these are moments of freedom. Leaders are unable to control the love of people for each other.”</p><p>In these moments, something universal within us is ignited. And radicalization and revolt follow as day follows night.</p><p>‍</p><h2>HISTORY LESSON</h2><p>I bought a used VW beetle and drove all over America.</p><p>I was 200 miles from Memphis when Martin Luther King was shot and the riots broke out everywhere at once. I headed south to Mexico, then deeper into Central America. Through Nicaragua when General Somoza was still in power. Through Guatemala and Costa Rica and Panama. I spent half a year in what was then still called British Honduras.</p><p>Chatting with all the other five-dollars-a-day backpackers, I learned the real story of how the Panama Canal was built. How, before Castro, Cuba was America’s gambling brothel. How the CIA trained death squads in Brazil and propped up Pinochet in Chile and let Baby Doc Duvalier run amok in Haiti.</p><p>The same questions kept bubbling up: What is America? The country was built on slavery, their Monroe Doctrine has been doing dirty deeds in Central and South America for a hundred years. They have a long history of interfering. Just as they were doing again now in Vietnam.</p><p>My father’s and my own love affair with America was taking a beating. Yes, America saved the world from the Nazis in World War II; however — at least at the level of their administration — they are not the beautiful people on the right side of history that I had so fervently believed in. It was like handing over my American History textbook and upgrading to Howard Zinn.</p><p>But on good days you could ride the cultural riptide out beyond those shoals and escape. The Beatles. The Graduate. Ginsberg. “Follow your inner moonlight; don’t hide the madness.”</p><p>Wherever I went I’d find a rep cinema and slide into the anonymous dark and catch a matinee.</p><p>‍</p><h2>FILM CAREER</h2><p>I returned to Japan, married my sweetheart and together we decided to start a new life in Canada.</p><p>The National Film Board of Canada had a reputation as one of the most exciting documentary filmmaking institutions in the world. No artist could fail to feel its pull. As soon as we arrived in Vancouver, I bought a 16mm projector and all I did the first few months was borrow NFB films and watch them over and over again.</p><p>Blew my mind.</p><p>Norman McLaren was a gateway drug to his brilliant, troubled protégé Ryan Larkin, whose psychedelic short <em>Walking</em> left me in an existential reverie. That you could take the private world in your head, your wildest and most profound stirrings, and splash them across a moving wall and still call it documentary, was a revelation.</p><p>Light, hand-held cameras and portable sound recorders were opening up new ways to make documentaries. All kinds of innovative cinéma vérité moves were suddenly possible.</p><p>A bunch of us started a film commune in the house on False Creek that’s now the site of the <em>Adbusters</em> offices. We made experimental films and subsidized ourselves by selling mandarin oranges from roadside stands at Christmastime.</p><p>The best thing we did was <em>Schizophrenic Superman</em> — a collage of comic book cutouts assembled to the beat of a square dance record I found in the basement. It was a big hit in the weekly film showings we held on Sunday nights, complete with cheap homemade beer infamous for giving everyone the trots.</p><p>For the next 15 years I made documentaries. My first real success was<em> Ritual</em>, a half-hour documentary about Japan shot mostly with a handheld Bolex camera. PBS picked it up and it aired repeatedly across all their affiliates. This was my passport into the NFB, and over the next 10 years I made a series of documentaries for them, mostly about Japan.</p><p>But it was while making a film about the global economy that I had a bit of an epiphany. I interviewed many mainstream heavyweights, but it was a small group of maverick economists who took me by surprise. They said things like, “Stop making money out of nothing,” and “Existence is a free gift from the sun,” and “Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever is either a madman or an economist.” Prominent among them was Herman Daly, a former Yale economist and author of <em>Steady-State Economics</em>, who said, “We are ruining this planet . . . like a business in liquidation.”</p><p>This was a revelation to me. It made me wonder if there was something fundamentally wrong with “the dismal science” and the whole way our global economic system is managed.</p><p>*</p><p>Over time, though, the NFB lost its mojo. It was sad to see, this legendary organization losing its relevance. But it happens, right? Dynamic institutions are shooting stars. They blaze and then fade away. Whole countries. Whole cultures. The whole Planet?</p><p>Bureaucracy was slowly choking the NFB (as Peter Jones, one of its legendary producers explained to me just before he retired). Where once the director-magicians ruled, bottom-line-driven executives now called the shots. They killed the film board’s creative spirit.</p><p>I knew it was time to move on.</p><p>‍</p><h2>CULTURE JAMMING</h2><p>In the spring of 1989, British Columbia’s forest industry launched a slick multimillion-dollar campaign called “Forests Forever.” On billboards, in newspapers and on TV, the government bragged about the marvelous job it was doing managing the province’s forests. Rest easy British Columbia, their ads proclaimed, you’ve got nothing to worry about, you’ve got “Forests Forever.”</p><p>A few of us green-minded filmmakers were incensed. We decided to come up with our own 30-second TV spot telling the other side of the story: that British Columbia’s old-growth forests were being logged at an alarming rate and the future of this precious resource was far from secure.</p><p>But when we tried to buy airtime, we were in for a shock. Nobody would take our money.</p><p>We decided to fight back . . sent out press releases . . . got our story into the Vancouver Sun . . . started a newsletter . . . launched a legal action against the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).</p><p>We never did get our counter-ad on the air, but in a victory of sorts, the CBC finally relented and stopped running the <em>Forests Forever</em> campaign. We were ecstatic.</p><p>Meanwhile, our newsletter had become quite popular. It was exhilarating to have a voice, to speak truth to power. When I told my journalist friends I was thinking of turning the newsletter into a proper magazine, they warned me against it. (“Your garage will fill up with unsold copies. You’ll go bankrupt. Your wife will divorce you.”)</p><p>Taking a cue from a little NGO startup across town named Greenpeace, we called ourselves the “journal of the mental environment.” We printed 7,000 copies of issue #1 and sold half of them locally in Vancouver.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6074d7cda272541b350e414f_eric_utne_and_bill_mckibben_265x392.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""1990: ERIC UTNE & BILL MCKIBBENHOLDING ADBUSTERS #3""></div><figcaption>1990: ERIC UTNE &amp; BILL MCKIBBEN HOLDING ADBUSTERS #3</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>In the beginning <em>Adbusters</em> was a typical Lefty rag, full of impassioned essays, rants against evil corporations and fervent calls for radical change, with nary a photograph or cartoon for comic relief.

A journey, you might say to get off the grid; to blow up the norms of print; to abandon that sanitized, soul-destroying modernist look . . . to create a magazine that was less about the content you “consume” than a river you jump into and are swept downstream.</p><p>The first thing we did was kill off the page numbers, because they are just speed bumps that break the spell . . . like someone pulling out a measuring tape in the middle of sex.</p><p>And who needs a table of contents? Or article headings? Or even a contributors page? On a fiery mind journey, who needs to be interrupted with pronouncements?</p><p>Then we took the letters to the editor and sprinkled them throughout (a very democratic move).</p><p>Then we ripped ads we hated out of other magazines and used them as counterpoint (a reversal of capitalist appropriation).</p><p>We started dropping in cartoons and poems, not randomly like the <em>New Yorker</em> does it, but carefully, where they’d resonate with flotsam in the flow.</p><p>I once heard the story that Yasujiru Ozu measured the worth of his films by how many bottles of sake he and his collaborator drank over many weeks concocting the script. Every issue of <em>Adbusters</em> was a little like that . . . a passionate one-off affair . . . a visually driven comic-book flow from cover to cover. If you read it front to back a kind of emotional momentum would build.</p><p>After a few years, <em>Adbusters</em> was all over Canada. And then the US. By the mid 1990s we were selling briskly on newsstands around the world.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:595px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""595px""><a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/spoof-ads"" target=""_blank""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/607728ad61cd5dcef7cc167c_adbusters_apoofads_595x530.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Adbusters Spoof Ads Samples"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></a></figure><p>‍</p><p>What everyone remembers from that period are the spoof ads on our back and inside covers. Absolut Vodka. McDonald’s, Philip Morris, Obsession, Nike. We went after any mega-corporate ad campaign that pissed us off. These companies had spent millions to build a nuclear glows around their brands, and now, in deft, judo-like moves we threw them on the mat with their the power of their own momentum.</p><p>That’s culture-jamming, baby. Let’s have some fun.</p><p>And then, we decided to take them all on at once.</p><p><em>Buy Nothing Day</em> was our first big social-marketing success. We caught the zeitgeist. The fledgling environmental movement was banging the drum that overconsumption was at the core of all our planetary woes.</p><p>We produced a 30-second TV spot showing a pig wallowing on a map of North America. The voice-over threw out some sobering figures about consumption levels, and chided that “the world could die because of the way we live . . . Give it a rest. November 26 is Buy Nothing Day.”</p><p>The meme spread. Buy Nothing Days popped up in Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Austin, New York. It jumped the ocean, to Sydney and Melbourne, then to London (where they called it No Shop Day). Within a few years, <em>Buy Nothing Day</em> was a yearly celebration of frugal living in over 60 countries around the world.</p><p>We learned that if you let loose a tantalizing meme at just the right cultural moment, it can hit the public imagination with incredible force.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6080ad490c918d5a0ac3b325_28MemeWarOnCampus_600x392.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>We noticed that some teachers were using our magazine in their classrooms; they even had their students making spoof ads.

Culture jamming had became a new activist playground.</p><p>We produced a flurry of 30-second TV spots.

When everything – even ecological disasters — make the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) go up, something doesn’t add up. “Economists,” we suggested, “must learn to subtract.”</p><p>In our brainstorming sessions we plotted a full-fledged onslaught against the trillion-dollar corporate advertising machine. Inspired by how the anti-smoking TV spots had demolished Big Tobacco, we now wanted to turn commercial television into a battleground of competing ideas. To fight an all-out meme war — where our mindbombs are constantly taking the piss out of the corporate pro-consumption agenda. We thought that this kind of culture jamming on TV would capture the imagination of the world, and we were confident we would win this meme war.</p><p>But again — just like with <em>Forests Forever</em>, the TV stations refused to take our money.</p><p>The ABC network’s commercial clearance boss Art Moore was predictably defiant. “There’s no law that says we have to air anything,” he shouted at me on the phone. “We’ll decide what we want to air or not.”</p><p>NBC’s Richard Gitter said, “We don’t want to take any advertising that’s inimical to our legitimate business interests.”</p><p>And Robert Lowery at CBS finally put it straight. “This commercial . . . is in opposition to the current economic policy in the United States.”</p><p>I remember getting a creepy sense of déjà vu listening to remarks like that. I was born in Estonia where during Soviet rule people were not allowed to speak against the government. There simply were no media channels for debating controversial public issues because the government did not want such discussion to take place. And here I was 50 years later in “the land of the free” and there was a lack of media space in which to challenge consumptive, commercial and corporate agendas — you were not allowed to speak out against the sponsors.</p><p>We spent $100,000 fighting a legal action against the CBC, arguing that every Canadian citizen has the right under the Canadian Charter to walk into their local TV station and buy 30 seconds of airtime for a message they believed in. The legal squabbling continued for more than 10 years, until we could no longer afford to pay the lawyers their $500 per hour fees. (One of our lawyers, Clayton Ruby, had a conflict of interest that utterly destroyed our case, but he refused to take responsibility or give back any of the vast sum we’d paid him. I will never forgive him for that).</p><p>But it turns out that nothing is more tantalizing than something that’s been banned. People wanted to see the rejected ads, to know why they were rejected. Our culture jamming anti-ads circulated widely.</p><p>And we made a lot of people question what television, the most powerful social communications medium of that time, was really all about if citizens can’t buy airtime under the same rules and conditions as corporations do. After all, doesn’t Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly state that: “Everyone has the right . . . to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes . . . the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”</p><p>‍</p><h2>DISENCHANTMENT</h2><p>At the apex of the <em>Adbusters</em>’ flight path, as our worldwide circulation climbed beyond 100,000, a strange thing happened. I became disillusioned. Or rather, I became pretty profoundly disappointed with the other kids in the sandbox. And me too in there with them.</p><p>We Lefties just weren’t … making things happen.</p><p>A protest could draw a million people, but then everyone resumed business as usual. Internet campaigns whipped up great anticipation, but then a week later you hardly even remembered what they were about.</p><p>We whined. A lot. We knew what was wrong with the world but had no idea how to fix it.</p><p>And excuse me, but when did the Left start taking itself so seriously? Where did the “people’s laughter” go? Weren’t we the people who knew how to live, love, think and have fun?</p><p>And, you know, care? About the big stuff?</p><p>I saw my compadres fighting smaller and smaller battles. Choking on critical theory. A sort of self-purification program seemed to be happening – an “I can hang my head lower than you” one-upmanship of gooey liberal guilt that was frankly embarrassing.</p><p>The Left suddenly just … wasn’t cool anymore.</p><p>And that’s not trivial. Because when you lose your cool you lose your influence. Cool’s sneaky superpower is its ability to propagate, to replicate in some critical mass of human minds. Lose that and you’ve lost the game.</p><p>I wrote an editorial saying, “The time has come to jump over the dead body of the old Left.” And I’ll never forget how the progressive luminaries of the time came down on me. Like I had betrayed the side.</p><p>After 50 years of identifying as a Lefty, I realized I couldn’t in good conscience wear that label anymore.</p><p>And then something happened.</p><p>Like a Basho poem read on the floor of a stock exchange. Or welders at Toyota laying down their torches and praying to the fire gods.</p><p>No doubt about it, the image of the ballerina on the bull had its roots in Japan. Serenity in chaos.</p><p>As a call-to-arms image it worked like a charm. But that’s not why Occupy Wall Street ignited. It ignited because people were furious.</p><p>What was happening in the United States, in the spring of 2011, violated the sense of fairness that Americans have always believed in. They knew there was something very wrong at the heart of the financial system. The guys in those towers had gambled away the farm. And they got away with it, while others suffered.</p><p>Recent graduates saw their future simply vanishing. They stared down endless debt and precariousness — a bottomless black hole.</p><p>At the same time, in the Middle East, young people rose up and chased corrupt President Ben Ali out of Tunisia . . . Tahir Square kept pulsating until Egypt’s long-time dictator Hosni Mubarak crumbled . . . it was exhilarating . . . it felt like the beginning of something big . . . we said to ourselves: Why can’t we do something like this . . . in our brainstorming sessions we kept on asking: Why not an American Spring?</p><p>We came up with an audacious idea: Let’s go to the iconic heart of global capitalism on Wall Street and occupy the damn place.</p><p>We chose my mother’s birthday, September 17, to kick it all off, and started pumping out tactical briefings.</p><p>We sent the first of 34 briefings out on July 13. It read:</p><p><strong>#OCCUPYWALLSTREET: A Shift in Revolutionary Tactics</strong></p><p><strong>Alright you 90,000 redeemers, rebels and radicals out there…</strong></p><p><strong>On September 17, we want to see 20,000 people flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens and peaceful barricades, and occupy Wall Street for a few months. Once there, we shall incessantly repeat one simple demand in a plurality of voices.</strong></p><p>We started talking to activists on the ground in New York. David Graeber and the local activist community mustered. And on Sept 17 it happened: a peaceful battalion of a few thousand marched to the bull.</p><p>In Zuccotti Park the mood was ecstatic.

On October 3, more than 700 protesters were arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>And it spun out. Occupations popped up in Chicago, LA, Seattle, Atlanta, Miami, Washington. The wave of protest jumped borders: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver. And oceans: London, Paris, Madrid. Sydney. Jakarta. Bangalore.</p><p>At its height, there were occupations happening in more than 2000 cities around the world. For a few heady weeks a tantalizing question hung in the air: What if the whole world turned into a Zuccotti Park? Could this be the beginning of the first global revolution?</p><p>It was uncannily similar to what happened in 1968 when a small uprising in the Latin Quarter of Paris spread like wildfire around the world. For a few heady weeks back then we also thought a world revolution had begun.</p><p>*</p><p>Looking back, what killed the momentum of both the 1968 protests and Occupy Wall Street wasn’t that people failed to put their asses on the line. They did. But we failed to deliver what every revolution needs: one big issue to galvanize around.</p><p>We didn’t have our memes figured out. We had the ear of the world but couldn’t muster much beyond a few cryptic pronouncements. We kept shouting, “We are the 99%!” But when winter crept in and Mayor Bloomberg ambushed us in the wee hours of the morning, we lost our momentum and will to fight back.</p><p>OWS fizzled out, went out with a whimper. At least that’s what people say.</p><p>But I don’t see it that way.</p><p>Those three months in 2011 reinvigorated the left and stoked a debate about inequality that’s still gathering momentum today.

And what he saw excited him. Something fresh was coming up between the old intellectual swamp gas of the Left and the poisonous xenophobic populism of the Far Right: a generation of intellectually daring young politicos who aren’t easily categorized.</p><p>They put out small magazines that punch way above their weight. (“The point of little magazines is to think big in them,” as Lilla put it.) These magazines are peppered with references to George Orwell, the mystic writer Simone Weil, Hannah Arendt, the young Marx, the cultural conservative American historian Christopher Lasch . . . they argue about Heidegger . . . publish critiques of neoliberal economics and environmental policy as severe as anything you can find on the Left. They rail against unregulated global financial markets, neoliberal austerity, genetic modification, consumerism, soulless modernism. They say that the European Union has been centralizing all the power in Brussels, conducting a slow coup d’etat in the name of economic efficiency. </p><p>Some of them believe in zero growth. They want Big Tech reigned in — calling for a dismantling of the Google-Facebook-Amazon troika that’s mindfucking us.</p><p>They’re passionate. Committed. They have a plan.</p><p>The catch? There is a strong strain of social conservatism about them. The Left wants nothing to do with these Young Turks because their plan comes from an ideology that’s grounded in tradition, and even faith.</p><p>That sounds radical to me. In the best way.</p><p>It speaks to a spiritual dimension that’s gone AWOL on the Left. A dimension I fell in love with in Japan. So many of the Shinto-based rites I explored in my documentaries are about cherishing your ancestors and acting in a way that reflects honor upon them. That attachment to the past, to tradition, to legacy, gives meaning to our lives. These are stories that started long ago and will continue long after we’re gone.</p><p>Lilla had somehow exposed the bigger picture that the Left, I feel, has turned its back on. Yes you are fighting the good fight for equality, human rights and justice, but you are also part of an “organic continuity” that stretches back thousands of years. On this view, the fundamental task of society is to pass on a kind of moral code to future generations — to put people into the larger organic flow of things.</p><p>What the job of society definitely <em>isn’t</em> is to become a clubhouse for “autonomous individuals bearing rights,” as Lilla puts it.</p><p>When I read that, I thought to myself, “fuck,” this is basically what I’ve deep-down believed in all my life.</p><p>For the last 20 years, I’ve increasingly felt that we on the Left are marooned in a dry place and don’t know how to make the flowers bloom. There was a piece of the puzzle of living that the Left wasn’t giving me. And all of a sudden, I sensed it, felt it, unbelievably, coming from the Right.</p><p>*</p><p>One of those Lefty shibbeloths – and I know I’m going to get into trouble here – is abortion.</p><p>Since <em>Roe v Wade</em>, a woman’s right to choose has become such a given that it’s now a reflex. Somewhere the lofty principle of justice got uncoupled from the primal human response to the sacrifice itself. Because sitting with the triumph and the horror at the same time is just too hard.</p><p>To allow that abortion makes you uncomfortable isn’t the same as saying you’re constitutionally against it. But I dare you to try it. The slightest hint of ambiguity around the issue strikes the Left as outright treason, and the blowback you get is calibrated to kill.</p><p>Well, fuck it. I mean, come on. We’re human. We contain multitudes, and all that.</p><p>I do find it strange that progressives can be “pro-life” in every context but this one. We fight tooth-and-nail against the death penalty, against war, against state-sanctioned killings across the globe. Even meat is murder. Progressives are about the sanctity of life above all else <em>except in this one domain</em>.</p><p>And I get why this issue’s different. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always felt that a woman has the final say about whether to go through with her pregnancy or not, and nobody should ever take that right away from her. All I’m saying is, if a life is taken, it should be done with the same reverence as happens in every other context. Whatever a fetus <em>is</em>, it is not medical waste.</p><p>There’s a Japanese Zen ritual called mizuko-kuyo — literally the “water baby” — that has found its way to America. As practiced in the States it is surprisingly politically generous. This is not just something pro-choice families embrace. It is a sacred rite. We mourn lost life here no less than the descendants of soldiers mourn the dead at cenotaphs, or Argentinian mothers mourn those “disappeared” in that country’s Dirty War. An activist drugged and thrown from an airplane into the ocean; an unborn baby sectioned and vacuumed from a womb: if the thought of both of those doesn’t make you hang your head a little, paralyzed with emotions bigger than you can hold, honestly, I’m not sure where we go from there. If we can’t find a place to meet in things that are the very denominator of our species, what hope is there for us?</p><p>*</p><p>I am 79 years old. Sometimes I feel like simply saying, as Wittgenstein did, “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life,” and call it a day.</p><p>But there’s one thing that continues to excite and tantalize and bedevil me. It is a new vision of what it means to be a political animal in the 21st century.</p><p>Somewhere rooted in an ancient philosophy, brought forward into contemporary times, lies the way out of this mess we’re in. It is a politics beyond politics, a system that will bury the whole Left vs. Right paradigm for good.</p><p>And I know, we heard this kind of talk from Tony Blair and Bill Clinton in the ‘90s, and the new consensual model that was going to come up the middle between capitalism and socialism and create kinder, gentler human dealings forever. That model seems to have sowed the exact opposite. Now no one’s talking at all.</p><p>What’s emerging this time is different. It’s not a movement of political parties or of the government; it’s a movement of regular people, coalescing in cyberspace. It behaves uniquely and evolves organically. Within its many-chambered heart lies a secret so fucking dangerous and beautiful that it opens up all possibilities for governing ourselves in the future.</p><p><em>This</em> is the Third Force.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6080951b5c773a0057f7a30d_new_left_the_third_force_450x256.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure>",,,"<p>— Kalle Lasn (from our forthcoming book, <em>The Third Force: Field Guide To a New World Order</em>)</p><p>Also featured in Adbusters issue 153.</p>","I have no memory of my birthplace of Tallinn, Estonia.

His new book has just been released in the United States as <em id="""">Slow Down: The Degrowth Manifesto</em></p><p>‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Adbusters: Degrowth, as an economic game plan, is still a fairly fringe idea. But the traction your book is getting suggests it’s maybe it’s about to win mainstream acceptance. Are you surprised by the impact of the book?</strong></p><p id="""">Kohei Saito: The book sold more than a half million copies in Japan, which is a huge number — especially for something connected to Marx. It’s been translated into 14 languages now. In Germany the book came out in summer and had a very good reception there, high on the der Spiegel list.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: What’s going on?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Well, a few things have contributed to a kind of revival of Marxist thought. During the Covid pandemic, the contradictions of capitalism — like economic inequality —became quite manifest; the treatment of (low-paid) health workers was really bad in Japan. At the same time, people have been struggling with the climate crisis. But they do not find convincing solutions to these problems within mainstream discussions. So they’re reaching for more radical ideas. And they’re investigating Marx. This new interpretation of socialism – what I call degrowth communism, or “eco-socialism” – is kind of enriching our imagination.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: The big reveal of your recent work is the contents of these newly discovered notebooks that Marx wrote late in life. We learn that he had a nuanced understanding of ecology and earth systems. I think it’s a big surprise to many that Marx had any kind of environmental sensitivity at all! But you’re sort of dusting him off for a new generation.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many people believed that Marx had nothing more to say. But then a few things happened. One was the economic crisis of 2008. Then three years later we had the Fukushima nuclear disaster. At that point the problems with capitalism were becoming hard to ignore. I started thinking... okay, capitalism has something to do with this — the maximum use of energy and resources is a characteristic of our daily economic activity under this system. But Marx seemed so outdated.</p><p id="""">Then I was lucky enough to get invited onto a project to edit these late notebooks of Marx. And I saw this deep investigation of natural sciences: biology, agriculture, chemistry, geology. Marx dove into so many different topics, from soil erosion to deforestation to extinction of species at the hands of humans. I was like: wow. Because we think of Marx as basically focused on the exploitation of workers. But looking at these notebooks, another concept emerges: metabolism.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Metabolism?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Marx understood that humans and the environment area natural system, a metabolism unto themselves; humans interacting with nature is a circular process. But capitalism is a system of constant expansion and acceleration. The result is economic inequality and ecological catastrophe.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: How do you reconcile the early Marx, as people understood him, with the much more... enlightened guy who emerges in these notebooks?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: We often think of these philosophers – not just Marx, but Kant, Hegel and other thinkers — as having some kind of consistent theory of the world. But they are also human. So they change their minds. We think of Marx pushing this idea that constant growth is good and technology is always liberating. But these were ideas expressed while he was still young. And these notebooks were late Marx. In between the publication of The Communist Manifesto and Capital was a gap of almost twenty years. During that time he started studying this global metabolism. And what he realized was, okay, I thought that technology is always good, it brings about more growth and it solves the problems of poverty, inequality and hunger and so on. But then he came to realize, wait: these technologies are used to control the worker. And they exploit nature, too. And then he starts to question these technologies. Maybe they are not emancipatory at all. And that’s when he started using the term “robbery.”</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Robbery?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: The robbery by humans of nature. He started to think about how human technologies could become more sustainable. And by the end of his life, these ideas compelled him to abandon his optimistic view of growth.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Was he specific about how it could all work?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: He didn’t integrate these ideas into Capital — the best known of his works — before he died. But by looking at these notebooks we can get hints of the direction his thinking was going. So we have a new way of reading Marx and re-imagining socialism. And that’s important, because capitalism is not working very well and we need some fresh ideas. I’m not saying we should immediately implement these ideas. But we should at least discuss them.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Some have described degrowth as a kind of “middleway” between capitalism and communism.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Yes, that kind of discussion about degrowth has been there since the ‘70s... you know, limits to growth, the Club of Rome and so on. And in France there was a rich discussion along these lines, with people like Serge Latouche. Latouche presented degrowth as “a middle path” – not socialism, not capitalism. A third way. I’m much younger than Latouche. What I’m trying to do is overcome the antagonism between Marxism and degrowth – or more generally, I’m trying to overcome the antagonism between Green and Red – between the environmental movement and socialism.							</p><p id="""">There’s a broad feeling that working-class people just want to consume more, that they just care about money and wages and so on. And then Marxists criticize the greens as a bourgeois group with the money to consume organic products and so on. This debate is no longer useful. Because it’s obvious that both workers and nature are suffering from capitalism. So it’s important to build a new alliance between green and red. And my idea of degrowth communism is an attempt to do that. We need a new dialogue, a new way of thinking about post-capitalism.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: You’re calling the escape plan ‘degrowth communism.’ Is there such a thing as ‘degrowth capitalism.’?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Well, there are degrowthers, like Herman Daly, who don’t explicitly reject capitalism; they think we could put some regulations on the market and achieve a steady-state economy without really challenging the fundamentals. I’m more critical of how markets function and how money functions – maybe it’s the difference between the older and the younger generation of degrowth. Look, capitalism is about growth. It’s about the constant, endless valorization of capital. This is Marx’s definition. So, no, I don’t think ‘degrowth capitalism’ is possible. Degrowth capitalism is bad capitalism. If degrowth capitalism is happening, you’re in a recession. By definition. Under capitalism, if you’re not growing, you’re failing.</p><p id="""">When the economy is no longer growing, you need to distribute the existing wealth. People need to share, in a democratic manner. That means a progressive tax. And you have to share mobility – that means more investment in public transportation. And you have to share telecommunications and education. These are the socialist ideas of guaranteeing a certain quality of life. The idea of luxuries beyond that — everyone gets a second or third car, the latest model of iPhone, which some socialists still try to advocate — that has to be abandoned. We must seek a different kind of abundance: a radical abundance.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: That’s a Jason Hickel term, yes? I’d be curious what that means to you. The idea that even if we can’t grow boundlessly in material ways, we can grow in other ways. Like, there’s a kind of richness to be had even in a degrowth economy. What does that abundance look like to you?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Abundance in capitalism looks like a big house, big car, big investment in real estate. It’s about monopolizing – for yourself and maybe your family too. It’s the pursuit of a very individualistic way of life, which has ecological impacts.</p><p id="""">When Marx talked about “abundance” in his later years, he meant something totally different. Something closer to what Jason is talking about. Or Kristin Ross’s idea of “communal luxury.” Or as I say, “public luxury.”</p><p id="""">So what are these kinds of abundance? They are not consumptionist. For example, we could have abundance of knowledge, through free public education. That’s not monopolizable: knowledge isn’t monopolizable. We could share. And become richer.	</p><p id="""">Fast free Internet should be available to everyone, everywhere on Earth. That’s the condition for a truly democratic politics. Public transportation should be free and widely available. Other things: Medical care. A decentralized network of renewable energy. More wind and solar power (sunlight is free!). These are the kinds of abundance people need. Abundance of mobility, abundance of education, abundance of health care. These are basic pillars of a good life. So you make them free and everything flows from there. We should treat these things as commons. A society based on the commons is basically communism – that’s the root of the word.</p><p id="""">The alternative is what we see (in the capitalist First World). Education is very expensive. Medical care is very expensive in places like the US and Japan. We need to work extra hours to pay for education and health care and housing. And we destroy the planet, we get stressed. And then we try to relieve our stress by consuming more.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: When people think of socialism, what a lot of them bridle at is that it’s anti-choice, it’s anti-freedom.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: But actually, the opposite is true. When you decommodify basic services, people have more freedom. If you don’t have to work so hard you’re freed up to make choices that are better for the planet and better for you.</p><p id="""">That has been my personal experience in Germany and the US. I went to undergrad in the US. And education there is super-expensive. I would see my friends, who had interesting, creative minds and very communitarian impulses, with a staggering debt load at the end of college that forced them to make bad choices. Some of them wanted to work in the non-profit sector, but they couldn’t afford to. So they held their nose and went to work for Morgan Stanley. But in Europe education is free, so they spend eight years in uni. And emerge debt-free. They can follow their dream. That to me is abundance.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: But green growth is a lot easier to sell than “degrowth, ”isn’t it? I mean, Americans are just not going to voluntarily give up their capitalist perks. So what do you think it’s going to take before people are ready to say, Okay, you know what, I’m ready to try this crazy-ass degrowth experiment?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: You’d think the pandemic might have been a spur. But many people quickly forgot what the pandemic was like. Even a shock like that didn’t change our behavior – that’s an unfortunate fact. But at the same time, without these kinds of shocks, I recognize the young generation particularly – think Greta Thunberg – have started to advocate for radical change of behavior, and even system change.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Millions followed her out of their school rooms.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Something like that was unimaginable even ten years ago. Our standards are changing. And I think our values could also change.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: You think?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: They already have.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: It’s true that a lot of radical ideas have seeped into the mainstream — like (the Korean director) Bong Joon Ho winning the best picture Oscar for Parasite. Or even the success of this new book of yours.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: When I started studying these kinds of issues, society didn’t really care about degrowth. My book wouldn’t have got any traction at all. But a new consciousness is spreading. And in the next ten years it may spread all over the world.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Marx has been defanged.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Maybe.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Let’s talk about Japan. Some people have said that the first industrialized country to pull off a degrowth revolution may be Japan. The novelist Ruth Ozeki says Japan infuse sone with a kind of Shinto sensibility of “care for the world.” Might Japan be the bellwether here?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Well, one reason my book became popular in Japan is that the economy has been stagnating for, like, thirty years. So people are thinking, something’s not working. Has our culture hit a wall? Will the economy ever grow again?</p><p id="""">In Japan, we often compare ourselves with the US and China, and we feel that we are living a more miserable life because our economy is not growing. But I don’t think so. If you look at economic inequality, the US is much worse. Security? It’s quite safe in Japan. Environment? We have lots of forests and rivers. We have a good culture, and good food. All these things are not reflected in the GDP. So to the Japanese people who are depressed with our slumping GDP, I say, why not just invent another index, one that takes into account air quality, environment, equity, culture, etc. And then Japan can say, Hey, we were just measuring economic progress wrong: Actually, we are Number 1 (Or at least in the top 10.)</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Marx was fascinated by non-capitalist and pre-capitalist societies – ancient societies – that were sustainable. He found they were “steady state” economies. They seemed to thrive without growth. Everyone maintained a pretty good quality of life. You’ve written about feudal Japan in that way.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: People fail to appreciate how sustainable Japanese culture was during the Edo [feudal] period. In recent years, we’ve begun to realize that during this period our country had what we now recognize is a sustainable society. The population was stable, and we did not rely on material inputs from outside.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Some people say, well, you know, the Japanese will be able to pull this off because they know how to “eat bitter.” Self-restraint is in the culture. But maybe ‘eating bitter' is not really what’s required here. Like, if you’re trying to convince people to ‘eat bitter,’ nobody’s going to buy that. Nobody wants to live like that. But someone like Jason Hickel would say, Austerity is exactly the opposite of what this degrowth movement is, at heart. We have to think of it as abundance, not shrinking.</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Right. And that’s the tricky part. This society, capitalism, is built on the idea of infinite growth without limitations. It compels us to ignore limitations. It compels us to work harder and harder for the sake of accumulating more money. That’s exhausting. People get burned out. (And then to deal with the stress, they buy more.) </p><p id="""">So maybe we should liberate ourselves from the pressure of more consumption and more work. And maybe that leads us to a more satisfactory, a more communal way of living — with more time for reflection, more time to slow down to gain autonomy.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Do you call yourself a Marxist?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: Yes, I’m a Marxist scholar. I like to promote Marx and Marxist thinkers. But I’m open to other traditions – anarchism, environmentalism. I’m not dogmatic. If we can vome up with better terms than socialism or degrowth, I’d be up for that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AB: Has there been any idea that has occurred to you since you published this last book that, if you had thought it, you’d have included it?</strong></p><p id="""">KS: One of the issues is war. The war in Ukraine happened after the publication of the book. In a war, people’s priorities shift. War is immediate life-and-death. People don’t think about the environment. </p><p id="""">And now the world is split in two – China and Russia (and Iran and a couple others) on one side, and the US, Europe and others on the other side. Degrowth seems less attractive when the world is geopolitically unstable. People in Japan say, if we degrow, we become weak and China will invade us. Climate, inflation, war, populism... all these things are now mixed up. I’m trying to now figure out this more complicated process.</p>",,,,"An Interview with Kohei Saito, Kohei Saito, a professor of philosophy at the University of Tokyo, seems poised to become the new Thomas Piketty, winning scores of converts to anti-capitalist economics within mainstream Western culture.

He had the air of someone who got a phone call and had ten seconds to flee the premises. Speaking sof tly, torquing up the sense of menace, he laid out the whole conspiracy in granular detail. How birds were systematically killed with poison gas launched from high-altitude bombers over Area 51. If he met skepticism, he doubled down.

We can’t agree any more what on we’re even talking about. Consumer capitalism was the fat target for years, but in the post-truth era, the jammer’s wedge is aiming deeper, into the root system of the giant bullshit generator of the Internet.

The rules were simple: You keep producing more things for people to use, and the market system fairly distributes these things; wealth trickles down and everyone’s life gradually gets better.</p><p id="""">And this was great news to Daly because making the world better was what he deeply wanted to do. He was — still is — a man of principle. And economics seemed to be not just a lens to study human well-being but a lever to influence it. Here was a tool to salve the crushing poverty he’d seen in his travels through Mexico and northeastern Brazil. To lift the world’s poorest out of their misery and increase aggregate wellbeing. Open borders, free trade, fast money. You keep growing the pie until there’s enough for everyone — and you just have to be sure the pie is growing faster than the human population.</p><p id="""">But a funny thing happened on the way to a Ph.D in economics, and subsequent teaching posts in the US, Brazil and Australia: Daly realized he didn’t believe what he believed.</p><p id="""">Neoclassical economics, it had dawned on him, was a bogus construction, a castle built on quicksand and ethically questionable to boot, measuring the wrong things in the wrong way. It’s small-minded in several senses: it doesn’t operate at the level of the planet or the human soul.</p><p id="""">In retrospect it’s a good thing that “the scales fell from my eyes gradually,” as he puts it, and not suddenly. Because then the jig would have been up. He never would have gotten his PhD at Vanderbilt and certainly never been granted tenure at Louisiana State University. He was inside the gates before the administration knew what they had on their hands.</p><p id="""">Daly was — still is — a different kind of cat. He has an almost Platonic idea of what an economist could and should be — a student not just of markets and supply curves but of philosophy and religion and ethics. He doesn’t even like to call it “economics.” Too bloodless and mechanical. He prefers “political economy,” which implies the swish and swack of real humans working things out. He calls himself an ecological economist, but it took some serious cognitive gymnastics to count himself part of this strange field at all. Especially after he found himself, in 1988, in the institutional belly of the beast.</p><p id="""">That year the World Bank had hired him as a senior economist. It was a weird fit. Daly was crossways with a lot of the bank’s policies: full-guns global free trade and open borders and frictionless capital mobility. (Daly’s view is that you ought to double down on domestic production and develop efficient internal markets first — and then start moving the chips to the international table.) But Daly’s job was pretty specific. Lots of countries wanted World Bank funding. Daly was to evaluate them in terms of their environmental sustainability.</p><p id="""">One day a draft report came across his desk. There was prominent diagram labeled “the economy.” An arrow entered from the left — “inputs” — and exited on the right — “outputs.”</p><p id="""">Simple.</p><p id="""">Too simple.</p><p id="""">Daly scratched his head. It doesn’t say where the inputs come from, he thought. And it doesn’t say where the outputs go. There was no indication that all this was taking place within a finite Earth. It might have been titled Economics in Space. Or Economics in Fantasyland. In a truer telling, readers would understand that the economy’s more like a hot-dog eating contest. There are physical limits to the stomach. Beyond a certain point not even Joey Chestnut can jam another frank in there without it — and likely a lot more — coming back up.</p><p id="""">Daly looked again at the diagram. What would Kenneth Boulding — an alternative economist Daly admired — have made of this? Or Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, his rock-star thesis advisor at Vanderbilt? Not to mention Garrett Hardin or Paul Ehrlich or Rachel Carson or Daly’s other heroes outside of economics, who maybe had a clearer view of things from their remove. By this point Daly had little doubt of one thing: for the field — let alone humanity itself — to survive, economics would have to re-invent itself.</p><p id="""">He took out a pen and drew a circle around the “input/output” arrow, to indicate the finite limits of Planet Earth. Then he sent this comment back to the higher-ups. Then he waited to see second version of the diagram would look like.</p><p id="""">When it came back, he saw they’d put a rectangular frame around the diagram, to pretty it up. No circle. Nothing about inputs and outputs. </p><p id="""">Daly wrote a long email explaining what he was trying to say.</p><p id="""">When the final version came back to him, the whole diagram was gone. It was like he’d been suggesting a geometric dimension that the Flatlanders see.</p><p id="""">But if the World Bank was a day late and a dollar short, that’s because it was just amplifying the same messages students were learning in freshman economics. Daly was asking bigger questions, the kind the social sciences should ask but often don’t. What is life all about? It can’t just be procreating enthusiastically and getting good deals at Banana Republic. Is there nothing loftier going on in the minds of people as they navigate the choice points in their day? On what grounds are these so-called “rational actors” making these decisions? Is anyone sitting at the adult table?</p><p id="""">Daly and his friend and colleague, the theologian John Cobb, had just published a deeply ethics-based book called <em id="""">For the Common Good ...Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment and a Sustainable Future.</em></p><p id="""">As the two clarified each other’s vision of the ethical life, they realized it absolutely collided with economics as it was being taught. Neoliberal economics, Daly reasoned, was at once too materialistic and not materialistic enough. But that wasn’t the biggest problem.</p><p id="""">The biggest problem was that obsession with growth. </p><p id="""">According to the dogma, “enough” is not enough. Humans are naturally insatiable. We want more and more, so we are continually dissatisfied. (Wait, if that’s true, there would be no need for advertising to convince us that there is no such thing as enough, to keep the dissatisfaction refreshed, Daly mused.) Growth is economists’ get-out-of-jail-free card. It’s a cover for never having to face the messy facts of inequity and the conflict it creates — because as long as everything keeps growing, per the theory, everyone will have enough so inequity won’t be an issue.</p><p id="""">Actually, Daly said, enough is enough. And he set out to prove it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The old measuring stick</strong></p><p id="""">Western economists boldly quant out progress and prosperity the old-school way. The metric is GDP: gross domestic product. That’s basically the sum total of goods and services a nation is producing. Problem is, there’s plenty that doesn’t show up in the accounting, like things that impact the environment, local communities and quality of human life just generally. And a lot of what does show up in the “goods” column are actually “bads.” Daly remembered a line of Ken Boulding’s. “He said that Gross National Product oughtta be called Gross National Cost because so much of it is a cost.” As a measure of “prosperity,” GDP — was as flawed as a bank balance that only shows the cheques you got, not the cheques you wrote.</p><p id="""">(A favorite analogy of Daly’s is the difference between a snowball rolling down a hill and an embryo maturing in utero. One’s merely getting bigger, while the other is getting bigger and also developing. That difference is everything. And it’s a difference GDP can’t see.)</p><p id="""">In a perfect world, Daly reckoned, this would be law: rich countries don’t get to grow their GDP anymore. Poor countries get a little more slack. But nobody is allowed to take their eye off the ball of planetary limits.</p><p id="""">“The world cannot stand another decade of economists who act as if nothing were sacred but economic growth,” Daly pronounced at one point.</p><p id="""">To be clear, this man is no firebrand. He’s a mild-mannered, straight-shooting academic, pretty much without guile. He’ll make bold unpopular claims without considering the feathers that might ruffle. Hey, nothing personal, it’s just the truth.</p><p id="""">But of course, to the establishment, them’s fighting words.</p><p id="""">When you’re hired to be the magician’s assistant, you don’t start blabbing at dinner parties about the rabbit up the guy’s sleeve. Ronald Reagan himself spun the yankee narrative that “There’s no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits on the human capacity for intelligence, imagination, and wonder.” Daly was slaughtering sacred cows faster than a McDonald’s in New Delhi. No wonder he pissed so many people off.</p><p id="""">From the moment he began teaching, Daly faced furious pushback. Even tenure (at Louisiana State University) didn’t protect him. Many of his colleagues turned on him. He eventually had to stop taking on grad students because their association with him was hurting their chances of getting jobs. He was pretty much excommunicated. When he was away at conferences, his wife Marcia sometimes received threatening calls. Once she was so spooked she packed the kids in the car and fled town.</p><p id="""">During his tenure at the World Bank, a private email from Larry Summers, then chief economist and vice-president, was leaked. In it, Summers made the case that the dirtiest industries should move to the poorest countries. Because they were “underpolluted.”</p><p id="""">Summers the rock star eventually became Chief Economist of the World Bank and then President of Harvard University. And Herman the apostate quietly moved on.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The new measuring stick</strong></p><p id="""">So, if the textbook Western economic paradigm doesn’t work, what’s the alternative?</p><p id="""">By Daly’s lights, only one model works in a so-called “full world” such as ours, where there are no longer any unexploited resources, and someone has made a claim on every square inch. And that is a steady-state economy.</p><p id="""">Here’s what that means. There are two ways to contain the physical scale of the economy, and both involve holding something constant. The first way is to hold constant “throughput” — the amount of stuff passing through the system, the sum total of new shit we humans generate. Basically, keep consumption at a level consistent with ecological sustainability.</p><p id="""">The other way is to hold steady what Daly calls “the stocks of people of artifacts.” In other words, limit the number of machines generating all that shit: us.</p><p id="""">This is controversial. There’s no way to say it without sounding racist (since it’s the poorest countries that are populating above replacement) and Daly has backed away from talking about it (though not from thinking about it).</p><p id="""">The truth is that actually confronting the crises, containing the human pressure on the biosphere, may require going to the dark places in the human psyche no one wants to go to. The pressure on the planet is a combination of the number of people and the amount of energy used per person. You simply can’t have an environmentalism without reducing those things. (And preferably both of them; in the poorer countries, the first one’s most important, and in the rich countries the second one is.) Moreover, a working steady-state economy wouldn’t just cap expansion — it would cap inequity. By, say, limiting corporate profits to some multiple of the average workers’ wage.</p><p id="""">You could say, stretching only a little, that Daly’s commitment to the steady-state model came out of something that happened to him in his youth.</p><p id="""">As a young child, he contracted polio. Nerve damage in his left arm shriveled it to a stump, which was amputated the summer he turned 15. That changed him physically. But Daly himself has speculated about how it may have changed his mindset. When you’re suddenly down an arm, you start thinking about making a life within the bounds of what is physically possible. That’s a very un-American idea when you think about it. Isn’t anything supposed to be possible if you work hard enough?</p><p id="""">When you’re facing the flat-out impossibility of something. What’s the best thing to do? You don’t deny it; you face it. You stop sinking energy into making pigs fly, and instead switch your energy into the things that are still possible. And many things still are. The closing down of one avenue nudges you to explore other possibilities that may, in fact, be the actual way out. Especially if you are a man of faith.</p><p id="""">Daly is a Christian, and though he doesn’t talk about it all that much (and is angered by the “Christian Right”), the tenets of his faith have underwritten everything he’s ever done, from his pushing for desegregation in Nashville in the early Sixties … to his collaboration with the World Council of Churches program for a Just and Sustainable Society in the 1970s, and his insistence that ethics must be baked into any social enterprise — including economics.</p><p id="""">*</p><p id="""">At this point you may be wondering: Can a steady-state economy even work within capitalism?</p><p id="""">Daly’s view is that it can.</p><p id="""">Despite the way his old neoclassical colleagues may have painted him, Daly is not an outright Communist.</p><p id="""">As a boy Herman worked for many years stocking shelves in his father’s hardware store. Later, those thousands of fiddly little nuts and bolts and screws became a stand-in for goods in the economy. How do you know what and how many to stock? Demand will tell you — better than any central planner ever could. Daly never lost the idea that the market has a role to play. The problem is that the market no longer functions properly in a full world. It goes wonky, like a compass near the North Pole. It isn’t allocating resources equitably — and it won’t until caps on growth are in place and working.</p><p id="""">But getting rid of markets altogether is not the solution, in Daly’s view. “If you try to get rid of markets, you’re really creating a problem,” he has said. “Markets can be good servants, as well as bad masters.”</p><p id="""">Capitalism doesn’t have to go, in Daly’s view. But it does have to change. Specifically, you have to defang its two most destructive elements. “If you take away from the capitalist system the ability to damage the environment and to concentrate wealth beyond all reason,” he says, “then I think you will have made a big step forward.”</p><p id="""">But the other part of the contract falls on us hairless apes. We can’t just be trying to tech-tweak our way out of this mess. We still have to rein in our ravenous consumer impulses. So the big efficiency gains in, say, solar panels aren’t enough in themselves. You can add a talented new forward to the team who nets you a goal more a game, but if your goalie sucks and lets in five goals more per game, you lose.</p><p id="""">Okay, Debbie Downer, Daly hears. This steady-state model of yours. Aren’t you basically consigning us all to a bland fate of morbid self-restraint and eternal unfun?</p><p id="""">The answer is No. Because not growing in size doesn’t mean not growing.</p><p id="""">And this is key to understanding where Daly is coming from. Zero growth does not mean a prison of stasis, where misery is torqued up until violence brews. On the contrary. In a steady-state economy there can still be growth. In fact, there must be growth. It’s just that it’s a different kind of growth. It’s closer to the kind of growth a therapist speaks of. It’s growth of the sort many of us glimpsed during the depths of the pandemic — where people pulled back from the consumer economy and went to ground with those they loved, exploring new passions, letting the crud settle to the bottom and the water clear.</p><p id="""">Growth, in other words, measured differently: not in quarterly earnings and output and GDP, but rather in the ways that actually count. Growth in craftsmanship, longevity, harmony, wisdom. Growth not in quarterly earnings but in ecological health and free time and, as John Stuart Mill put it, “the art of living.” Growth, even in “spiritual improvement,” if that kind of language comes off your tongue. An economy can work — and improve — even if it’s not growing, and the formula is simple: you share more, build better and buy less. You consciously value leisure and fun, and you put an actual cost on destruction in the pursuit of profit. Aesthetics start to matter more than just about everything. That doesn’t mean the color of the drapes — he means intense experiences over dull ones. Truth, justice, beauty. When those things grow, the world doesn’t strain at its seams. The opposite happens. A little more room actually opens up.</p><p id="""">For much of his life, not many people were buying what Herman Daly was selling. But now that he is 85 years old, the world is coming around to him. A new generation is beginning to accept the idea that the world used to be empty, and then a kind of tipping-point happened, and now it’s full. So we have to think of economics differently.</p><p id="""">“The work of most economists, and of social thinkers more generally, becomes less relevant as time passes,” says the progressive Canadian economist Peter Victor, who has just released a deliciously readable book about Daly’s work and life. “But this work becomes more relevant.”</p><p id="""">New ways to measure progress are gaining traction, alternatives to GDP that measure not prosperity but something closer to “well-being.” Like Daly and Cobb’s Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (redubbed the GPI, or Genuine Progress Indicator). Or John Halliwell’s “Happiness Index.” Even the World Bank, that old dinosaur, pays much more attention to green issues now, looking at alternative metrics to how we’re doing. (Better decades late than never.)</p><p id="""">Daly has a tremendously fertile and felicitous mind. But he is the first to acknowledge that he greedily absorbed big ideas from the greats. From Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen he learned that economics actually had a roomie and it was physics — any closed system becomes increasingly random, and degrades. From Ken Boulding, he learned that economics is a small story embedded in a big story, that human concerns make no sense outside the context of Spaceship Earth. From Garrett Hardin he learned that rules to keep us from running selfishly amok in the sandbox work, so long as they’re mutually agreed on (that’s how we avert the Tragedy of the Commons). From E.F. Schumacher he learned, per the Buddhists, that people are more important than goods, and the kind of work we do matters, not just how much.</p><p id="""">Now Daly himself has become a solid perch for a new generation of thinkers to stand on, to peer over the curve of the memescape, and devise ways to get us out of this mess. Without Daly, it’s hard to conceive of ideas like Tim Jackson’s “preventative environmental management,” or John Fullerton’s “regenerative capitalism,” or Kate Raworth’s “doughnut economics” (where, between the shortfall inside where people go hungry, and the overshoot outside, where systems collapse, is the band in the middle — the doughnut itself — where humanity progresses sustainably). Daly’s life’s work is a kind of existence proof for the wobbly, right-brain leap of faith that the human project is going to require — putting faith in the wisdom of living systems.</p><p id="""">Daly thinks the first developed nation to take a shot at a steady-state economy could be Japan.</p><p id="""">“Japan is halfway to becoming a steady-state economy already, whether they call it that or not,” Daly told the writer Ben Kunkel not long ago. The elements are there. A stable — even slightly declining — population. Natural limits on resource extraction (as a small island nation) so there’s “a long history of having to live within limits.” And Japan’s already doing things to rein in inequity (like imposing limits on the earnings multiples of executives to employees).</p><p id="""">There’s a line of the climate ecologist Gernot Wagner likes to use: “It’s too late to be pessimistic.” Daly shares that view too, to a point. The sad irony is that it took the five-alarm fire of the climate emergency for the skeptics to weaken their resolve against him. “Big changes usually require a big crisis to make them politically possible,” Daly says. “Maybe things have finally become sufficiently dire.</p><p id="""">“After the present system crashes in failure there will be not only an interest, but an immediate need to rebuild something more sustainable and just.”</p><p id="""">To economics students shuffling into their econ 101 seats and cracking their copy of Principles of Economics, by Mankiw (9th edition), Daly has this charge: Think about how crazy it is that you’re being asked to consider economic growth without planetary constraints. “One might as well ask engineering students to fathom how far a car can run on its own exhaust, or biology students to accept that an organism can metabolize its own excrement.”</p><p id="""">Daly’s “living system” metaphor for the economy may ultimately be viewed as profound and important as Lovelock’s Gaia Hypothesis.</p><p id="""">And it will probably follow the same trajectory, too. At first dismissed. Then ridiculed.</p><p id="""">And then finally — after it’s proven right — accepted as self-evident</p><p id="""">all along.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/63741d0e205decc5c1983100_herman_daly_brushes_600.gif,,<p><strong>- Bruce Grierson</strong></p>,"Is the world finally ready to listen to Herman Daly, father of ecological economics?",false,false,false

A history-erasing disinformation campaign waged on Facebook, TikTok, and other social-media platforms. Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. (who goes by Bongbong, his childhood nickname) has sought to sanitize his father’s murderous two-decade reign, portraying it as an era of growth and prosperity for ordinary Filipinos. Millions bought these lies — just as they did six years ago, when previous president Rodrigo Duterte (whose daughter, Sara, is set to be Bongbong’s vice) ran on a similarly truth - eliding platform of bravado and bloodlust. Duterte’s wrecking-ball style of leadership is still massively popular, as shown by his successor ’s rapid rise to power. Did the efficacy of Bongbong’s digital demagoguery deliver him the win? Or was it a matter of autocracy ’s organic appeal?

Pumped up with piles of shadowy money, Bolsonaro’s online campaign ushered in a perilous new period for the young democracy in which untruth reigns nearly unconstrained. As another election approaches this autumn, the risk is that Brazil has its own January-6th moment. There are rumblings already that Bolsonaro intends to follow in the footsteps of his American counterpart by questioning the integrity of the voting process and refusing to concede, no matter the outcome. It’s a fragile situation for the fraught re public, where the military dictatorship is less than four decades dead and “corruption” is both a poisonous dog-whistle and a perennial reality. WhatsApp, despite do-good promises, is still fumbling to staunch the spread of lies. Meanwhile the capture of the country ’s mental environment is proceeding unhindered.

Then it took over the country. Officers of Myanmar’s army took out the phone lines, the TV stations, and finally the internet. They rounded up members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) mere months after it won a majority in parliament (which previously shared power with the military) and just one day before elected representatives were to be sworn in. Among those jailed were President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the legitimate civilian leaders of the country. Three NLD par ty official s died while in the custody of police. Thousands more have been arrested, and hundreds killed, in crackdowns on dissent since t he coup d’état of February 1, 2021. Crucially, it all took place while under cover of social-media darkness. Face book , Instagram , WhatsApp, and later Twitter were shut down during the height of the repression, stifling efforts to organize protests as well as appeals for condemnation abroad. When things came back online , distrust and disinformation spread like chickenpox. Accounts nominally belonging to NLD officials were suspected of being hijacked by the junta. None of it would be out of keeping with the military’s practice of sowing hate and lies online, often translating to homicidal violence — not least against the Rohingya people. Until the next heave for freedom, democracy in Myanmar remains offline. </p><p id="""">‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:450px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""450px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6328d1ac7095104058f8c15e_india_facebook_450.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Alongside an explosion in the use of smartphones came a veritable mushroom-cloud of murderous disinformation. In just a handful of years, India has become the country with the largest number of Facebook users in the world, at over 300 million and counting; WhatsApp has seen a similarly massive surge in uptake. From the start, the conditions were ripe for malign interests to make quick work of the chaos. Indians on Facebook use 20 of the country’s 22 official languages to communicate with one another, only half of which the platform monitors for false information. Limited familiarity with the digital world also means that few have the resources to make sense of the muddle of truth and lies. This all has proved a boon to religious extremists, many of whom hold significant cachet with mainstream political parties — not least PM Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In recent years, tensions within Indian society have spilled over into sectarian conflict with greater ease thanks to social media. In the weeks leading up to the Delhi riots of 2020, for example, when street violence led to the deaths of three dozen Muslims and over a dozen Hindus, the incidence of “inflammatory content” — hateful rhetoric — shot up to three times above normal, according to an internal report from Facebook. Much of the strife plays into the hands of the BJP, for which online threats of bloodshed have the power to intimidate its critics into silence. With social media as its mouthpiece, the BJP is a step away from remaking the country in its image: bullying, intolerant, and verging on fascist.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:450px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""450px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6328d1f1896fe67fe7bbfbb7_russia_putin_450.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Viewers of Soviet television must have known something was up when, in the summer of 1991, regular programming was interrupted by a performance of Swan Lake. Hardline communists had kidnapped the reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev and launched a coup d’état — developments too embarrassing to mention on state TV. Days later the coup had failed and Gorbachev was freed, but by the new year the collapse of the Soviet Union was complete. It was in reference to this moment that, in March of this year, the news channel Dozhd (a.k.a. TV Rain) — among the last independent outlets in Putin’s Russia — broadcast a film of Tchaikovsky’s celebrated ballet on YouTube before calling it quits. The station had already been smeared by the Kremlin as a purveyor of “deliberately false information” for covering the invasion of Ukraine critically, and its editors forced to register as “foreign agents” as part of a wider effort to discredit dissidence. Many of its staff had fled the country out of fear not only for their jobs but for their safety. Then, two days before it went offline, access to TV Rain and its social media was set to be throttled on the orders of Russia’s prosecutor general. Why? In an absurd twist of truth again calling back to Soviet times, the channel was accused of “calling for extremist activity” and fomenting “violence” — this for taking a staunchly anti-war stance. TV Rain is far from alone. Since the start of the invasion, a government-led crackdown on its opponents, both on the airwaves and online, has all but strangled an already stifling environment for free expression. Yet the message, along with its champions, remains resilient: in June, having escaped Putin’s grasp and relocated to Latvia, TV Rain began to stream once more. </p><p id="""">‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:450px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""450px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6328d2491553b7009ef9713e_israel_palestine_450.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p id=""""><br></p><p id="""">The Israeli state and its media toadies want you to forget about, to never think about, to lose the ability even to fathom the humanity of Palestinians — except, that is, as a uniform mass of foamy-mouthed terrorists. For the most part, social-media platforms are all too happy to go along with it. When longstanding residents of Sheikh Jarrah, a Palestinian neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem, faced forcible removal at the hands of Israeli authorities last May, for example, the likes of Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter swiftly censored the outcry. On Instagram, images and videos were flagged, posts removed, accounts disabled, and hashtags suppressed, all under the guise of “content moderation.” The Facebook group “Save Sheikh Jarrah” was taken down for “going against community standards.” Meanwhile, Twitter attributed the suspension of an account belonging to the Palestinian journalist Mariam Barghouti to an unexplained “error.” But it’s not just social-media execs: the wider Western mainstream is, as a rule, eager to toe the Israeli line. A telling instance involves the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh, champion of the Palestinian cause and veteran correspondent for Al Jazeera. By the time word of her murder got out — which took place in May, as Abu Akleh was reporting on an Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) raid on a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank — the waters were already muddied. Despite much evidence to the contrary, the IDF claimed the fatal bullet may well have been fired from a Palestinian weapon. Major media outlets consistently parroted this falsehood, until independent probes by the UN as well as the historically pro-Israel New York Times found it baseless, both concluding that Abu Akleh had been shot in the head by an IDF soldier. Israeli institutions have yet to relent and admit responsibility. Yet this should come as no surprise. After all, the basis for 75 years of occupation, oppression, and apartheid rests on just such an evasion of accountability, repeated again and again. And again. </p><p id="""">‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:450px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""450px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6328d396b225554b54d9bb39_usa_fox_news_450.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p id="""">Readers in the US: How often do you watch Fox News?

Each half operates according to its own logic, its own facts, its own truth: right is right, and left is left, “and never the twain shall meet,” as old Rudy once said. But the danger in letting the tension between these two sealed-off, mutually hostile worlds mount unchecked is that it risks snapping — and with explosive violence, bringing down democratic society along with it. “Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust,” said journalist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa. “Without these, we have no shared space and democracy is a dream.” It’s an outcome becoming less unthinkable with each passing day. What’s more, given the scale of the planetary endgame looming before us, there’s little hope for survival if history’s guiltiest culprit is caught up in consuming itself in endless culture wars, leaving survival (let alone democracy) to the realm of dreams and fantasy.

That is, if a shred of hope for any kind of future — indeed, if the planet itself — survives us. </p><p id="""">Of course, to try to list all the neglected wrongs of the past would be a futile exercise. The point here is not to be exhaustive but selective. Some cry out from the dark dungeons of history with more urgency than others. And if you listen closely, you just might recognize something familiar in their voices, even something of your own. True to Benjamin’s thinking, it seems injustice doesn’t die so easy after all.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p id="""">The first unavenged cause to consider is the cause of democracy. Not just your newscaster’s or your pundit’s democracy but the kind of democracy that reaches beyond the legislature and into the bank, the hospital, the break room, the trading-room floor. Make no mistake: democracy, in the narrow sense of elections and day-to-day political life, is everywhere either broken or threatening to break. Yet at the same time, a deeper erosion is taking place. Before even getting a ballot in your hands, the wind-up toy of politics has determined what kind of candidate you can vote for, and which is off limits. Even more radical candidates, in the rare instances in which they win, face stiff constraints as to what money-power will allow once they are in office. </p><p id="""">More and more, it is the interests of private wealth, not of the popular will, that decides the limits of political possibility. The big firms hold the pen that writes the law. The platforms own the means of communication. The oligarchs pull the strings of global finance. Money sloshes back and forth across international boundaries a million times a minute, while human beings pile up at militarized checkpoints only to face deportation, depredation, and death. Calls for a democratic workplace are throttled, and our needy neighbours are left for all-but-dead, while the proprietors of the workplace enjoy the privileges of legal leniency, tax delinquency, and the relief of public funds. There is one rule for the rich and another for the rest. So long as this two-tiered system exists, there can be no true democracy. It will remain a dream of the abstract, ancient past. </p><p>‍</p><p id="""">A regime of pillage calls out for redress, a regime of world-spanning imperialism. While the last empires seem to have died out by the close of the last century, they did so only in name. Today, there still exists a system of exploitation and expropriation that preys upon the vulnerable from the remove of the wealthy West — or more accurately, the Global North. It is based on the historically entrenched notion of racial and cultural superiority of some, on the one hand, and the expendability of rest, on the other. It deems some resources, and some lives, the justifiable targets of plunder, and a minority living far away its rightful beneficiaries. It is what gives shape to parallel forms of oppression based on the constructions of gender and race in the imperialist, which is to say capitalist, core. </p><p id="""">Imperialism is at play when workers paid less than a living wage in, say, Bangladesh make the cheap clothing bought by hard-pressed workers in North America. It is also at play when some, for the simple fact of their class or race or gender, face a disproportionate risk of complication and death when giving birth, for example, in the wealthiest nation on Earth. While the most brutal shape of imperialism has receded from view — the unabashed imperialism of slavery and genocide — it lives on in the hardly subtler forms of coercion, colonialism, apartheid, and debt discipline. Marching hand in hand with the forces aligned against democracy, imperialism — if it is allowed to persist — will ensure that a sane, sustainable world may never come to be. </p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Once upon a time, it was decided there is a divide separating “Man” from “Nature.” It was deemed the proper place of the former to dominate and despoil the latter. We are living today, as we face the total collapse of the possibility of life on Earth, with the consequences of this ideology when taken to its logical extreme. For centuries, despite all cries of warning, the nonhuman world around us has been treated as a neutral, infinitely renewable fount of exploitable resources. By whom? By the “Man” on the other side of “Nature,” who is no universal human being, but rather a highly particular one: white, wealthy, and male, comfortably inhabiting the cities of the Global North on the backs of legions at the fringes. Only in time did collaborationist counterparts outside his race, gender, and geographical milieu come to crib his method and play his games. </p><p id="""">Now, we live in a world crying out for relief. Yet for all the signs pointing towards our doom, we keep on marching along the cusp of the abyss. Even as the word “extinction” becomes part of everyday speech, the forests are razed, the oil is extracted, and the fumes belch forth into the warming air. Sea levels rise, threatening not only property values but the lives of millions. The temperature climbs. The storms get deadlier. The droughts become more frequent and more devastating. The altered climate threatens to unravel everything. Still, we are told there is nothing wrong with the way things are, only there are certain things about it that could be fixed — for the right price tag. </p><p id="""">This is the logic of species-level suicide, to say nothing of the plight of other life forms. It is baked into the machinery of capitalism, which runs blind on the inertia of profit. We cannot hope to go on as we have done without bringing on the conditions for our annihilation. We must cut the engine before it is too late. The trouble is, we don’t hold the keys; corporations, their operators, and their enablers in government do. It might be time to consider how we take them for ourselves, and by what means. </p><p id="""">Imperialism, democracy’s erosion, the death of nature: these three agents of historical peril are united, like an unholy trinity, in a further, overarching force. That force hardly needs naming: it is capitalism itself. Capital is what seeks to justify plunder at large in the interest of profits at home. It seeks to dismantle any real system of representation, and instead hold the reins of power for itself. It sees as its domain the whole of the Earth, which it will gladly squeeze to exhaustion, its own furtherance be damned. Capital is in it for today and for itself alone. Come tomorrow, if we do nothing to stop it, there may be nothing left for the rest of us. <em id="""">If we do nothing. </em></p>",,,<p>- Trevor Clarke</p>,"Every revolution, every authentic revolution, promises to redeem the failures of its predecessors.

They amount to tapping the brakes, when there’s just not enough runway left for that. We need to slam on the emergency brake, as the Japanese philosopher Kohei Saito puts it – to avert environmental and social catastrophe.</p><p id="""">We’re talking about a major, really unprecedented paradigm shift. Which exposes the question <em id="""">under </em>the question: Can it even be done? Is material growth inevitable? Or is it, as Wendell Berry once put it, “evitable”?</p><p id="""">Growth is a funny thing: it’s great until it isn’t. There comes a point, in every natural system on Earth, where growth triumphantly peaks. After that, more growth starts doing more harm than good. It becomes “malign, cancerous, obese and environmentally destructive,” as the Canadian research scientist Vaclav Smil said in his seminal book, Growth: from Microorganisms to Megacities. The curve of growth’s effects looks like an upside-down smile, and all the developed countries are now on the downslope, in the zone of what Smil calls “anthropogenic insults to ecosystems.” In other words: a shit storm on the horizon, about to make land.</p><p id="""">So for humans, Smil and others would say, the only way forward is to pull back – via a potent (but terribly named)phenomenon called degrowth – a term you’re guaranteed to be hearing <em id="""">much </em>more about as the air comes out of everything else.</p><p id="""">Degrowth might be defined as a voluntary pullback of consumption and production. Basically, it means attaching a retro rocket to consumer culture to decelerate it enough to bring it safely back down to Earth. All in the name of protecting nature, and saving the species in the deal.</p><p id="""">A simple idea. But obviously not an easy sell in the move-fast-and-break-things era, especially in a country like the US, whose citizens’ very identity is <em id="""">built </em>on the promise of growth, social mobility, improving your lot and your children’s it’s all up to you, bud.</p><p id="""">Degrowth has been a fringe movement for nigh-on twenty years, its constituency not much bigger than its sister movement on the other margin, so-called Effective Accelerationationism, dedicated to the balls-out pursuit of technological progress. No longer. Degrowth has to be taken seriously. That’s thanks partly to the five-alarm global eco-catastrophe, and young academics like Georgos Kallis and Jason Hickel and the Japanese philosopher Kohei Saito who have managed to put words to our utter inability to contain it with the usual tools in the shed.					</p><p id="""">Kohei is emerging as the new Thomas Piketty – the economist who rocked the world a decade ago with the declaration “it is time for socialism,” and converted many skeptics with a simple, brain-bending equation that seemed to explain why capitalism is toxic.</p><p id="""">Kohei is convinced capitalism is doomed by its own internal contradictions. His recent book, a surprise smash hit in Japan and Europe and forthcoming in English, paints a vision of a future where we all get to, you know ... survive. And also of his own journey to arrive at this vision.					</p><p id="""">As a young dude growing up in Japan, Kohei was deeply effected by two events that shaped his politics. The first was the financial meltdown of 2008 (when he was 22) and the second was the Japanese tsunami and Fukishima disaster three years later. The first turned<br>him into a socialist, and the second turned him into an environmentalist. Humans, he became convinced, needed to craft a new relationship with nature – something no political or economic system had really been able to manage. Because boundless growth was central to pretty much all of them, none could adequately contend with climate change.</p><p id="""">And then, in a twist worthy of <em id="""">The Da Vinci Code</em>, Kohei discovered that Marx, late in life, had left a trail of breadcrumbs to the promised land.</p><p id="""">In some notebooks written when he was an old man — and later suppressed for various reasons by various groups — Marx dug deep into ecological science. In an attempt to square the circle, he began to sketch a vision that took into account a finite Earth. In this light a new kind of Marxism emerged, so different from USSR-style version it should probably be given a different name. (Kohei calls it, pretty inadequately, “degrowth Communism.”) And Kohei’s belief in “green growth” went up in smoke.					</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><p style=""text-align:center; padding-top: 10px;"">*</p></div><p id="""">Green-growth sounds like the silver bullet of sustainability, a “balance” (as the Nobel-winning economist William Nordhaus put it) between environmental stewardship and peppy economic health. But the seductive veneer crumbles when you give it a shake. The idea that you can “decouple” the carbon economy from everything else, and slow down only the bad stuff; the absurd logic of carbon capture (putting “gobs of money into these huge factories that do nothing but take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere that shouldn’t have been put there in the first place.”); the devil’s bargain of “efficiency,” which serves to goose consumption — as things become cheaper, we make more of them, gobbling more energy and resources. Green growth is still growth, and growth takes more than it gives. What seems ingenious turns out to just push problems into a future our kids will have to figure out.					</p><p id="""">Green-tech “solutions” are super-seductive. And that, Kohei says, is the problem. Small virtuous-seeming actions – from recycling to eating less beef – give folks a false sense that they are meaningfully tackling the problem. Which “can end up causing more harm than good.” Kohei calls Green New Deal thinking “the new opiate of the masses.” It soothes and distracts from the pain of “the reality that must be faced,” namely that we are in the soup. Half-measures aren’t going to cut it. They’re like “damp January” – a dilution of the exercise that kills the point of the exercise.</p><p id="""">For awhile Kohei himself was a believer in the Green Growth middle way.

It’s <em id="""">What you have divided by what you want. </em>So there are two ways to get happier: increase the numerator or decrease the denominator. The first way – acquiring more haves – gives you a sugary buzz that quickly fades. The second way is the real jam. We can become happy, permanently and securely, by wanting less.</p><p id="""">Shockingly, even Charlie Munger recently came to almost the same conclusion. Just months before his death in November at age 99, Munger, Warren Buffett’s right-hand man and one of the main faces in the shop window of American capitalism, said something at the Berkshire Hathaway AGM that must have hit the arena full of shareholders like a gut punch: “I think the best road ahead to human happiness is to expect less.” “Expect less” and “want less” aren’t <em id="""">quite </em>the same thing, but in this company it’s staggeringly heretical; and in any context it’s a start, because expecting less can put pressure on you to want less, if only to resolve the little war in your own id.							</p><p id="""">So let’s dig into whether that’s even possible for an appreciable chunk of the human population to pull this off. The question we all have to ask ourselves is, What would it take for <em id="""">me </em>to commit to playing a much tighter game for the rest of my life? Could I survive in a no-growth society? Would I feel life is worth living under these conditions?					</p><p id="""">How much lessness could I actually handle? Is “today” me willing to take a bullet for “tomorrow” me? Can I be a “good ancestor,” planting trees whose shade I will never live to see, if it means considerable sacrifice right now? Can I really hold off on eating the marshmallow?</p><p id="""">If giving up some creature comforts is part of the deal of “the switch,” as Piketty calls it, there needs to be some psychological payoff in doing that. The reward may be at a deeper level than simple pleasure. A recent Gallup poll rated which countries’ citizens reported their lives were most meaningful. At the top were Sierra Leone, Togo, Senegal, Ecuador, Laos, Cuba and Kuwait. The last one aside, those are poor countries. “GDP ... may have an inverse relationship to meaning,” the psychologist Paul Bloom noted. It’s possible religious belief is a factor in those results, Bloom allows. But a more likely explanation is that “meaning results from struggle.” When everything is at our fingertips there can be no lasting satisfaction. “It’s no surprise that many citizens of affluent countries find that their lives lack purpose.” Fulfillment lies on the edge of just-manageable difficulty. Meaning requires at least some degree of suffering. In this case, by giving things up.					</p><p id="""">Let’s not kid ourselves: this is going to be a tough sell for folks who scratched and clawed to arrive at where we are now. As the deep-sea fisherman says, “Get all you can, and can all you get.” American-style appetites seem to be bred in the bone. Many believe those in the rich North simply do not have it in them to make such a pivot – to give up on the idea that <em id="""">we can still have it all. </em>That we can find a way to de-carbonize the world while still maintaining our current lifestyles.</p><p id="""">“Americans might well find themselves happier and more secure in an ultra-low-carbon communal economy in which individual car ownership is heavily restricted, and housing, health care, and myriad low-carbon leisure activities are social rights,” wrote Eric Levitz in <em id="""">New York </em>magazine not long ago. “But nothing short of an absolute dictatorship could affect such a transformation at the necessary speed.... Humanity is going to find away to get rich sustainably, or die trying.”</p><p id="""">Indeed, a sense of progress is so central to what humans need in their life that it arguably can’t be squelched entirely. But maybe it can be reframed.					</p><p id="""">Like so: We don’t have to stop growing. We just have to grow ... differently. In ways more meaningful to the human spirit. In ways the GDP doesn’t measure – like sustainability, equity and well-being.</p><p id="""">Looked at in this way, degrowth isn’t a bitter pill but a sweet opportunity. You’re tapping into the best of human nature, the parts of us that capitalism actually suppresses and stunts.</p><p id="""">This bears repeating. You can’t think of the degrowth shift as an “austerity” move. That’s bad marketing and it’s not even true. When we ease off of consumption and production, what we end up with is something much more positive, what the economist Tim Jackson calls “prosperity without growth,” and the anthropologist Jason Hickel calls “radical abundance.” This is a bounty captured not in material metrics like GDP, but in things like basic income for all, universal medical care, the decommodification of goods like housing that people need to live dignified lives. That kind of abundance can be the new foundation for culture going forward, says Kohei, because it is about equality. It’s about unlocking the commons, and unleashing a flood of new value many people did not realize was there.</p><p id="""">Sounds radical, but even John Stuart Mill, the philosopher and economist who first hatched the idea of a “steady-state economy” in the mid-19th century, glimpsed the spiritual promise in a program of ratcheting back GDP. “There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress,” he wrote.

Objects exist somewhere; they can be collected and hoarded; they persist in time. Experiences exist nowhere; they happen and are gone. If objects are stones and experiences are kisses, the project of a degrowth world is exchanging stones for kisses.</p><p id="""">Of course, everything is impermanent if your timeline is long enough. “A stone is just some sand that has come together for now,” as Rovelli puts it. So it should really make no more sense to try to hang on to stones than kisses. This is the aspirational state of non-attachment that Buddhists speak of, and there’s evidence that people are generally happier when they try to live this way – savoring experiences and letting go of things.</p><p id="""">Once we start thinking kisses, not stones, a great weight seems to lift off of us. And the world starts to make a little more sense. Every thing is really a relationship between something and something else. A web of kisses is better than a pile of stones.</p><p id="""">In a degrowth world, people would be less stressed. The steam valve of individual financial pressure would be eased. You wouldn’t be, as so many are now, one unlucky break from living on the street. There’d be some sort of housing assurance, a minimum guaranteed income.					</p><p id="""">Easing off of high-carbon activities like driving and into low-carbon activities like caregiving makes sense in a way your body understands. The tradeoffs that come from giving up your hyper-consumptive lifestyle might not seem a good deal on paper, but you try them and by god they feel like a bargain. Maybe you could handle life without a second car but a better relationship with your neighbour.					</p><p id="""">At the root of our continual craving for more more more is the loss of connections, Kohei says. We’ve busted the bonds of family and, one level up, of neighborhoods. When you lose community you create a void, which you try to fill by buying more shit. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p id="""">So then: less consuming and destroying, more learning and conserving.

This new lifestyle – planes grounded, consumption down – was demonstrably reducing carbon in the atmosphere. We proved that working less was friendlier to the environment and gave people a better life. As we slowed down, we had some room to reflect on our previous lifestyle. We realized it actually wasn’t bringing us all that much happiness. We just did it because we were used to it. But we could change it.”</p><p id="""">In the end these epiphanies did not stick. The paradigm shift never really materialized. “Capitalism is trying to bring us back to a ‘normal’ way of life,” Kohei says. Normal, but somehow worse.

But you can re-engineer your reaction to what comes of it. You can detach from the outcome. Once you’ve done what you can, you let the chips fall.					</p><p id="""">“If we cannot live happily without an assured future,” as Alan Watts once put it, “we are certainly not adapted to living in a finite world.” Degrowth has to be something we undertake for the right reasons.

It has to pass the test of, <em id="""">If no one were around to see me doing this, would I still do it? </em>The answer must be <em id="""">yes, because it just feels better</em>. It feels right. This behavior sits easier on my heart. It lowers my blood pressure.

As a first step we need to move from “I can’t see this truth” to “I <em id="""">won’t </em>see it.” We need to own our complicity. To stare at it. To survey our lifestyle of “wellness” in the rich North, and the South’s lack of it, and connect the dots.

Who will go first? If any industrialized country can pull off a “steady-state” economy, it’s Japan. “They’re already halfway there,” the economist Herman Daly told me, in the last interview he gave before his death last year. “The elements are in place. They’ve a stable – even slightly declining – population. They have natural limits on resource extraction as a small island nation. And they’re already doing things to rein in inequity, like imposing limits on the earnings multiples of executives to employees.” Because the alternative is living with the disintegration of our very souls.					</p><p id="""">Scaling back, you soon find yourself out of the red and into the black.

But it’s also important to remember we don’t have to shoulder this transition alone. To think we do is to let governments off the hook. ""Achieving degrowth equilibrium,” Kohei says, “is less about personal choices and more about changing overarching political and economic structures.” More sharing, less growth and concentration of wealth.							</p><p id="""">There are actually mechanisms available to governments that could nudge a degrowth future into being. These ideas seem radical, and implementing them would take some serious feinschmecking, but they would do the job of suppressing carbon overshoot by manipulating consumer behavior. They would include things like “true-cost”pricing, where every harm involved with bringing a good or service to market would be built in to the the price you pay at the till. Or a progressive “size tax” that’s slapped on corporations as they reach Brobdignagian proportions. Or a ban on flash-trading to cool international money markets. All these maneuvers together, along with others like them, would slow galloping capitalism to a canter, in a way that mere virtuous swerves by individuals could not.					</p><p id="""">As Kohei Saito was working on his new book, he came to think of it as a kind of love letter to his own nation. When Japan’s economy crashed in the 1990s, he saw his people hanging their heads in shame. The baked-in honor culture made them take the slump personally. They adsorbed it as a moral failing. Like: we should have worked harder. We should made wiser choices or figured out how to be more efficient. We were not equal to the challenge. This is on us.</p><p id="""">Actually no, Kohei says, it isn’t, because that story is not true. It’s not the moral strength or failings of individuals that determine the outcome of this game: it’s the house rules. We trade or we share. Capitalism went all-in on “we trade.” “We share” never really got a look in. It’s not you who are bad, Kohei wanted his countrymen to know. It’s the system that is rotten to the core.</p><p id="""">Even the most ardent exponents of degrowth allow that it can’t be cookie-cutter dogma. We have to suppress growth, yes, but selectively. “In some places (rich industrialized nations) we have to foster de-growth, but in other places (much of Africa) we have to foster growth,” says Vaclav Smil. The developing world is just now climbing out of this lobster pot. Degrowth does<em id=""""> not </em>say it should fall back in and die. It’s rich countries that are overshooting the most so need to shrink the most. But to Jason Hickel there’s an element of historical redistributive justice in the mix too – the Global North has most of the cumulative damage to the climate, so it’s incumbent on them to pull back more, in order to allow poor nations to keep growing.							</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><p style=""text-align:center; padding-top: 10px;"">*</p></div><p id="""">So to return to the big question from earlier, What will take for a significant number of people make such a monumental change? How desperate will things have to be?</p><p id="""">In some quarters it’s already happening, as countries tiptoe toward a kind of middle way anchored by degrowth. In New Zealand, Jacinda Ahearn’s government promoted the idea of “just-enough” growth. Growth per se isn’t the goal of the economy, she said: “enough” is. Enough for everyone to live as good a life as possible under the constraints of the environmental ceiling.							</p><p id="""">This is what Kate Raeworth called Donut Economics. The “donut is a zone of sustainable living” – between the deprivation of the “hole” and the overshoot beyond the glaze.							</p><p id="""">Smil thinks a mass shift to degrowth is totally doable. “We could halve our energy and material consumption and this would put us back around the level of the 1960s,” he told <em id="""">The Guardian</em>. “We could cut down without losing anything important. Life wasn’t horrible in 1960s or ’70s Europe. People from Copenhagen would no longer be able to fly to Singapore for a three-day visit, but so what? Not much is going to happen to their lives. People don’t realize how much slack in the system we have.”					</p><p id="""">Living by a growth mindset, as we do now, “will become something like smoking,” Smil believes. It was everywhere and then it was by and large gone as people realized the clear link to cancer. Governments snapped into action. Restrictions were placed. Taxes were slapped on. “The same will happen when people realize where material growth is taking us,” Smil said. “It’s just a matter of time, I think.”					</p><p>‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:839px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""839px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/65e8c9d4400485a0eeaa00e7_degrowth-5.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Who will go first?</strong></p><p id="""">If any industrialized country can pull off a “steady-state” economy, it’s Japan. “They’re already halfway there,” the economist Herman Daly told me, in the last interview he gave before his death last year. “The elements are in place.They’ve a stable – even slightly declining – population. They have natural limits on resource extraction as a small island nation. And they’re already doing things to rein in inequity, like imposing limits on the earnings multiples of executives to employees.”</p><p id="""">In a way, Japan seems to have been preparing for this historical moment for thousands of years. It is equipped with language and rituals to accommodate a degrowth future.</p><p id="""">There are Japanese words that uniquely capture the character traits we’re going to need to pull this off: Words like <em id="""">mottanai </em>(rough translation: “What a waste!”) conveys a sense of regret over pissing useful things away, and the imperative to conserve energy and resources; or <em id="""">wabi-sabi: </em>the idea that things get more beautiful, not less, as they age. This is the anti-consumerist ethic in a nutshell. Ancient rituals like the Japanese tea ceremony convey deliberately slow and mindful harmony with nature and one another. Haiku and other art forms lean on the ethic of subtraction. Subtraction adds intensity to what remains. This is how less can indeed become more.					</p><p id="""">All this pretty much runs counter to the capitalist idea of “progress.” Capitalist growth changes the environment. You’re making something new from the pieces that came in the box. And each successive generation has a dimmer memory of those original pieces.</p><p id="""">Young Japanese sense the genetic drift from their country’s original DNA. The environment is being disrespected – in away that’s totally orthogonal to ancient Japanese traditions. So it may be time to “eat bitter,” again. The Japanese can do it. They’ve proven it. “Until recently it was such a frugal and disciplined society,” Smil said, “that people there can tolerate what others would not accept.”</p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><p style=""text-align:center; padding-top: 10px;"">*</p></div><p id="""">The Franciscan monk Richard Rohr has some thoughts about a life well lived.

The sisterhood lights up the second I light my first cigarette – with five girls, in the back of a student bar. I talk about what happened to me out loud. The girls nod. It happened to them, too. </p><p id="""">I break the generational cycle of silence.</p><h2 id="""">I am one. </h2><p id="""">It's 1991. India is liberalized. For the first time since Independence, we open up to free international trade. Business is booming. The windfall profits trickle down to the educated middle class. Multi-billionaires mushroom. And my little family blooms because my father decided to take a risk and start a construction business in a country that needed only to build, build, build, build. </p><p id="""">Money, in less than a generation, transforms how healthy, safe and educated we are. It protects us from violence, from injustice. It insulates us from unpredictable shocks like natural disasters, sweeping government policy changes and big medical emergencies. So, I imprinted another saying under my skin: Money is freedom. I will stand on my own two feet and never fall into the chasm of poverty my parents worked so hard to protect me from.

I choose what I wear, who I'm with, what I drink and when I get home. I see the world. I get to leave my country and exchange it for streets that are pristine and safe. No one touches me without my permission. Whatever life throws at me, my credit card can absorb. It feels like cutting through fabric into another dimension. </p><p id="""">I have forgotten to look at price tags. When I go back home, my suitcase is packed only with gifts. In this very tiny, very wealthy country, if I keep my mouth shut, I pay barely any taxes, have spotless streets, trains always on time, all the food I've never tasted. On paper, it is everything a little girl from a little south Indian town should have wanted. But I have just replaced the strings of my community with those of a new master — the capitalist. </p><p id="""">These buildings get erected, these streets get washed clean, this machine is kept running in the dark by hands that look exactly like mine. I am running as far as I can from the oppressed, to fight for a seat at the table of the oppressor. At work, I am doing anything, really anything at all, to keep the engine of endless growth running. My job title represents everything I know to be wrong with the world. I spend 80-hour weeks selling a pipe dream. No time for anything else, or anyone. Every promotion is just the price tag for going along with a nonsensical startup Ponzi scheme. I curl like a millipede into the crippling depression I'm too proud to treat. </p><p id="""">I chose this. I was not the victim. </p><p id="""">I look all the way up the ladder, right to the top. And I ask myself if I want to be like them — the white men who write the rules. The tech bros and their venture capitalists, do I really want to feast at their table? </p><p id="""">It's so incredibly hard to stop, when everyone tells you not to, when you are still young enough to burn the hours working, when you've not saved for a rainy day and most of all, when the spectre of injustice looms over you like anxious nausea. </p><p id="""">I look over the chasm of uncertainty ahead. It is black all the way to the endless bottom. </p><p id="""">I decide enough is enough. I close my eyes, and run towards the unknown. Maybe all revolutions begin as little ones. Running has always been easy.</p><h2 id="""">I am thirty-one. </h2><p id="""">Here's a new country to try. New people. New language. New rules. </p><p id="""">My skin and the way I speak English feels uncomfortable, like a pebble in my shoe. My body, and my apartment, smell like curry. When I'm spoken to, at a party where everyone knows English but speaks French, the question they have is, ""what brings you all the way from India to France?"" I don't have a good answer. </p><p id="""">I wrangle my tongue to say their Rs. They cock their ears because they don't understand my accent. I know they could never pronounce the bumps and twists and knots of my mother tongue. Mazhathulli. Pachavellam. Avalosunda. I learn to say sœur, Bourgogne, particulièrement. They talk about yoga and drink turmeric chai lattes and eat butter chicken curry bowls and I gag. I watch them live off what their grandparents stole from mine. Scratch that. What they are still stealing, from people like me.</p><p id="""">They do it under the banner of ""economic development."" They raze entire peoples. And then they have the gall to segregate and dismiss people of colour, quietly, insidiously, in their own country into what they call ""the popular quarters."" </p><p id="""">I experience their lukewarm, shallow curiosity for my culture — such a polar opposite to my hungry need to assimilate into theirs. And yet, I find myself engulfed by the magnificence of everything here. I ignore the violence and extraction that made it possible. I look up at the opulence, the delicacy, the artistry, and I am at once enthralled and deeply saddened that all of this in my home has been allowed to fall to ruin, so that this new home can flourish. I allow myself to fall in love with their country and their language. Their wine and cheese and tomatoes and romantic boulevards and waveless blue sea. I say, I can have a beautiful life here. I say, I can belong here. It's a game, and the trick is just to play it well. I tell myself, this little corner pleases me. Even if I feel inferior and alien around these people, at least I have my Parisian apartment, and my summer vacations and free health insurance, right? </p><p id="""">In less than two years, I am politely told I no longer have a job. First the shock, then the anger. </p><p id="""">Then the relief. </p><p id="""">I take two weeks on a permaculture farm, with my nails grimy and my back broken, doing the thing that gives me most joy — growing things. Alexis, the only name I'll mention in this piece, was the farmer who allowed me to live and learn off his land. I went there to learn to grow food in a new terroir and reconnect with my childhood. Back home it is altogether normal and expected to eat things we grow ourselves. Permaculture quite simply soothes the aching to dig closer to my roots.</p><p id="""">In the course of two weeks, the farming was merely a backdrop to learning about the climate crisis. Alexis was a war correspondent, a politician and is a fierce educator. He pushed a book into my hands and said, read this. It was Less is More, by Jason Hickel. </p><p id="""">Something clicked. It connected everything I was questioning about the current economic order with a crisis that could eliminate our very existence as a species. The same tropes of imperialism, corruption, misinformation, human rights abuse, endless growth — here it was playing out on a planetary scale. It was all crises intersecting into one. </p><p id="""">I had always dreamt of some day going back home to Kerala to farm and cook and write. So I ask Alexis, ""should I just go back home?"" He says: ""Stay here, so that when your family is on the brink of death because it's too hot to survive, at least they'll have a safe place to go."" </p><p id="""">I pore into the data about how hot and unlivable most of the Global South will be in the next 50 years, how there will be mass migrations and displacement because of extreme weather events. I learn that the excesses I enjoy in this part of the planet are so inextricably linked to the floods that ravaged my hometown thousands of kilometres away. </p><p id="""">This is a problem I cannot run from.</p><p id="""">This little life has gone through all the stages of capitalism. </p><p id="""">The promises of early-stage capitalism were palpable in my childhood. All good things came to us because of my father's business— it was not excess, but opportunity. Then, working in tech in Asia exposed me to the capitalist boom — material abundance, that comes only with moral turpitude. I owe all the freedom I have today to it. All the promises made by capitalism, met. Your life can transform in less than a generation if you turn a blind eye, and work hard enough. </p><p id="""">And then in Europe, where late-stage capitalism sits in idle obesity. Centuries of loot keeping entire nations afloat. Imperialism that continues to this very day, breaking the backs of black and brown people, branding them as terrorists and savages when they resist, while Europeans protest for their four-day workweek and call themselves ""advanced."" </p><p id="""">But now, finally, the house of cards is wobbling in the wind. This extraction, they (and I) have started to realize, never stops. What started at first, far away, in countries like mine — is catching up to them. Now they pay attention. These ancient cobblestones have begun to thrum with the ochre of civil unrest. </p><p id="""">At the same time, my little heart, begins to call for an end to the apathy with which I've been making my own nest. Something tells me I've read enough, seen enough, felt enough to say ""enough — I am done being part of the problem."" I am done being quiet.

The worry wasn’t that the American people were suffering from want. The worry was that they were suffering from satisfaction. Folks appeared to have pretty much all they needed. They seemed — God forbid — <em id="""">happy</em>. This was a disastrous state of affairs. Because consumer capitalism is a whack-a-mole game that runs on craving; as soon as a desire is met, another pops up to replace it. Because (as the Buddhists have long pointed out) desires are insatiable, the game never ends. The moment you have all you want, there’s no need to keep buying stuff. Hoover feared that if people became happy, the economy would collapse.</p><p id="""">That Hoover paper, new to me, was one of the many surprises sewn into the lining of Ruth Ozeki’s new novel <em id="""">The Book of Form and Emptiness</em>.

What Japan seems to do to you — <em id="""">for</em> you — if you let it, is it infuses you with a kind of Shinto sensibility of <em id="""">care for the world</em>. That’s pretty much the opposite of consumer capitalism. When you make things cheaper to throw out than to repair, that element of care goes out the window.</p><p id="""">“The older I get, the more I appreciate how, when I own an object, I have to take care of it, I have to be responsible to it,” Ozeki said. “And so that in itself makes me want less and less.”</p><p id="""">At some level we’re all trying, pretty much continuously, to come up with a grand unifying theory to explain the world and maybe fix its shortcomings.

Perkins one day had a crisis of conscience, said a few Hail Marys, walked away from that life and moved his family to the Canary Islands, never to return. It was also the story of Ray Anderson, head of a multinational carpet manufacturer (and big environmental polluter). The night before he was to give a boilerplate to shareholders, Anderson had a road-to-Damascus moment.

La résistance, c'est ce que les gens ressentent lorsqu'ils ne peuvent simplement pas faire face à ce qui doit être fait. Quelque chose d'important se trouve droit devant eux, mais c'est tellement effrayant, tellement terrifiant par ses impacts dans leur mode de vie <em>confortable</em>, qu'ils ne peuvent pas y faire face. Ils résistent. Plus la peur est grande, plus la résistance est grande. Plus ils savent au fond d'eux-mêmes que ça doit arriver, plus ils résistent. </p><p>La résistance nous saisit lorsque le plus profond de notre âme reconnait l'importance de l'enjeu.</p><p>Comme maintenant. Dans le monde. Une convergence de problèmes créés par les humains qui nous ont amenés au bord du chaos total. C'est une crise existentielle tellement énorme, écrasante et merdique qu'on ne peut pas la voir pour ce qu'elle est. Parfois, ça prend une métaphore. </p><p>Je me souviens de l’expérience sur les souris de John B. Calhoun, il y a de ça 60 ans. Il était éthologue, et un jour, il construisit un enclos métallique dans le jardin d'un voisin dans une banlieue du Maryland, près de l'Institut national de la santé mentale où il travaillait. Il y a laissé quatre paires de souris reproductrices. </p><p>Au début, elles ont prospéré. Mais alors que leur nombre ne cessait de croître, dans cet espace limité, elles ont commencé à agir de façon étrange. Elles se sont retournées les unes contre les autres. Les mâles dominants ont formé des gangs itinérants qui attaquaient les autres. Les mères ont abandonné leurs petits. Les souris les plus faibles arrêtaient de manger et mouraient. D'autres se sont transformées en cannibales, se régalant des morts.</p><p>Et les souris survivantes ne sont jamais redevenues tout à fait bien. Quelque chose leur était arrivé. Elles n'étaient plus vraiment des souris. Celles qui n'étaient pas mortes physiquement étaient mortes « spirituellement », a expliqué le Dr Calhoun. </p><p>C'est évident là où je veux en venir, mais je vais quand même le dire : Nous sommes ces souris. Nous sommes huit milliards et plus, dans un enclos expérimental appelé Planète Terre. </p><p>Les écosystèmes s’effondrent. Les structures sociales tombent. Nous nous sommes polarisés en deux camps férocement opposés. Les gangs errent augmentent dans un nombre croissant d'États en déliquescence. Une course folle est en cours pour ce qui reste des ressources de la planète. Et dernièrement : des choses folles et brutales. La montée de monstres maléfiques comme Assad, Sisi et MBS. Le viol et la torture sont maintenant utilisés régulièrement comme armes de guerre.</p><p>Nous sommes en chute libre vers un avenir catastrophique, où tout est permis.</p><p>La Troisième Guerre mondiale sera incomparable à la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. Elle sera désintégrée, invisible, et partout. Elle va commencer — certains disent qu’elle l’est déjà - avec des escarmouches éclatent dans les régions défavorisées du monde. Avec la hausse de la température et l'effondrement des systèmes naturels, il va y avoir des pénuries et des émeutes de la faim. Le nombre d’États en déliquescence va passer du chiffre actuel de 20, à 30, puis 40 puis 50 et plus. Des réfugiés par millions vont d’abord mendier, puis se battre pour se frayer un chemin aux quatre coins du monde riche. </p><p>Et après, dans un moment de vérité géopolitique, un conflit va s'escalader pour devenir hors de contrôle en Mer de Chine méridionale. Ou bien Israël va soudainement prendre les installations nucléaires de l’Iran. Ou bien le Pakistan, empêchant d’accéder au Gange, va lancer une attaque nucléaire contre l’Inde. Alors là, la fin du jeu planétaire va vraiment commencer. La colère va s’enflammer même dans les esprits les plus tranquilles. Tout va dégénérer. Et personne ne sera en mesure de contrôler quoi que ce soit. Des centaines de millions vont périr dans une extinction mondiale et ceux qui vont rester glisseront dans une très longue ère de noirceur. </p><p>Ceci n’est pas une hyperbole. Nous sommes à un point de basculement planétaire. Le sort de notre expérience de six millions d’années sur la planète Terre est en jeu, si seulement nous avions la clarté d’esprit pour le voir. </p><p>Les choses peuvent aller dans les deux sens. Pour l'instant, c'est pile ou face. </p><p>Mais, ce mot « résistance » a une autre définition. Une définition plus positive. Cette dernière est une sorte de mouvement social.</p><p>On y pense souvent en contexte de guerre. La « résistance » est une vague de personnes qui s’organisent et se battent pour renverser une puissance militaire occupante — pensez à la résistance intérieure française contre les nazis. </p><p>Mais ce genre de résistance arrive aussi en temps de paix. Il s’agit simplement de la lutte par une partie importante de la population contre des circonstances devenues intolérables. La figure d'autorité ou le système au pouvoir a montré, par sa corruption, son incompétence ou les dommages graves qu'il a causés, qu'il a perdu tout droit à cette autorité.</p><p>Quand la résistance qui renverse le paradigme est non-violente, c’est un peu comme une épreuve de judo diabolique. Tout le monde en sort vivant, mais changé. </p><p>Nous assistons aujourd'hui à la naissance d'un nouveau type de résistance, un mouvement qui opère complètement en dehors des frontières géographiques et des structures politiques. <em>Une Troisième Force.</em></p><p>Les gens se rassemblent en ligne et mettent sur pieds ensemble de nouvelles façons d’influencer les politiques, d'exercer le pouvoir et de se gouverner. Nous allons au-delà de tout paradigme de politique nationale et commençons à penser et à agir comme une communauté mondiale. </p><p>Nous sommes les durs à cuire, les soignants, les brouilleurs de culture. Ceux qui se sont fait malmener et qui ont attendu pour notre propre argent. Ceux qui ont gravi les montagnes, mangé les champignons, piétiné l'herbe. Ceux qui se sont balancés sur les ponts, qui ont distribué des tracts dans les quartiers, qui ont lancé des bombes lacrymogènes aux voyous. Ceux qui ont acheté une banane à un enfant au hasard. Ceux qui ont pleuré toutes les larmes de leur corps la nuit où Charlie Parker est mort.</p><p>Nous sommes les artistes, les poètes, les philosophes et les punks. </p><p>Les vétérinaires sans abri, les femmes violées, les réfugiées qui flottent sur l’océan. Les ""déplorables"" qui viennent à l'esprit quand le poète dit : <em>tout le monde meurt, mais tout le monde ne vit pas.</em></p><p>La Troisième Force est la voix la plus diverse et la plus démocratique que le monde n’ait jamais entendue — vraiment la seule à défendre les intérêts de tous. Nous jouons une musique plus vraie, comme une immense chorale de chanteurs non entraînés qui, collectivement, s'accordent. C’est la musique de personne en particulier, mais de la planète en général.</p><p>Nous sommes le grand cri.</p><p>Nous ne sommes pas un parti politique. Personne n’a voté pour nous. Nous ne nous identifions pas à la Gauche ou la Droite.</p><p>Comme chaque percée se doit d’être, nous sommes une synthèse d’opposés. À partir de maintenant, la politique ne sera plus l’habituelle bataille entre les ombres idéologiques. Un troisième acteur avec un ordre du jour radicalement nouveau s’est joint au combat.</p><p>La politique ressemblera à ceci:</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/602ef1697997d1436fd5083c_new_left_arrows_450x236.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Nos gouvernements élus, les Nations Unies, la Banque mondiale, le Fonds monétaire international, etc. vont continuer à gouverner comme ils l’ont toujours fait. Ils vont construire les autoroutes, collecter les impôts, gérer les tribunaux, livrer le courrier. Mais, maintenant, ils vont devoir faire face à cette nouvelle voix silencieuse qui exige des transformations systémiques sur de multiples fronts.</p><p>Quand nous, le peuple, sentons que nos dirigeants n’accordent pas l’attention, qu'ils ne font pas les choses correctement, qu'ils dévient de leur trajectoire ; quand l’écart entre les riches et les pauvres devient trop grand ; lorsque les entreprises deviennent trop arrogantes, Wall Street trop avide, le secret trop omniprésent, la surveillance trop invasive et les agents de recouvrement trop impolis ; quand les normes, les valeurs et les préceptes de notre mode de vie sont violés . . . c’est à ce moment-là que nous, le peuple, nous rassemblerons pour remettre les choses en ordre.</p><p>Notre pouvoir réside dans notre nombre. Rassemblez suffisamment de personnes — des gens ordinaires avec leurs manches retroussées et leurs pieds enflés à force de rester debout toute la journée — et leurs cris deviennent une sorte de signal de rassemblement. Comme la réponse aux spasmes du système immunitaire mondial, déclenché par une insulte massive à la planète elle-même.</p><p>La Troisième Force est un nouveau « groupement évolutionnaire », un groupe qui se forme lorsque les conditions historiques sont réunies, <em>parce qu'il le faut</em>, pour accélérer le changement et donner une chance à l'humanité. La différence, cette fois, c'est que les résurgents disposent d'un nouvel outil, le premier téléphone arabe qui couvre le monde entier.</p><p>L’Internet a inversé une dynamique de pouvoir vieille de plusieurs siècles. Les plateformes de médias sociaux sont maintenant le troisième bras de la démocratie, au même titre que la loi et la séparation des pouvoirs du gouvernement. Ce n’est pas inconcevable que, d’ici quelques années, des millions de personnes convergent vers des centaines de sites web militants comme abillionpeople.org. C’est assez pour lancer des boycottages massifs qui mettent à genoux les entreprises récalcitrantes. Assez pour organiser des moments de big-bang mondiaux où les gens sortent dans leurs villes pour exiger un changement systémique. Nous, le peuple, pouvons désormais mettre notre nez dans chaque débat politique, chaque élection, chaque décision du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies, chaque conflit militaire. </p><p>Et nous pouvons pénétrer plus profondément encore, jusqu'au coeur battant de notre système mondial, en changeant les paradigmes, en inversant les flux financiers, en déclenchant des réformes, en empêchant les guerres.</p><p>La Troisième Force va graver ses initiales dans la culture avec ce nouvel outil — ce feu sacré que vous tenez dans la paume de vos mains.</p><p>Le Net est ce que nous en faisons. Il peut être un bourbier où l'on est aspiré, où l’on est soumis à l’agenda de quelqu’un d’autre pendant un certain temps et où l’on en ressort en se sentant diminué. Mais nous avons aussi vu des lueurs de ce que le Net peut faire quand il est exercé comme épée de résistance. La rapidité avec laquelle il peut provoquer une transformation sociale : Le Printemps arabe, #OccupyWallStreet, #MeToo, #BLM.</p><p>Nous apprenons tout juste à exploiter le pouvoir du Net. Pas de manière superficielle, en réagissant à toutes les quelques minutes au chaos, mais lentement — en apprenant à être des diplomates maintenant — en s'enfonçant dans les principes de base pour empêcher le chaos de se produire en premier lieu.</p><p>Si nous jouons bien le jeu, en gardant la clarté d’esprit, tout en restant libres, agiles, en improvisant des riffs, en étant des systémiciens de premier ordre, alors nous pouvons devenir la force politique dominante du 21e siècle. </p><h2><strong>L'Algorithme de la Révolution</strong></h2><p>Dana Meadows, la scientifique environnementale qui a coécrit <em>Les Limites à la croissance, </em>nous encourage à penser sous la surface. Dans son modèle de l'iceberg de la pensée systémique, les événements que nous voyons se dérouler, ceux qui font l'actualité, ne sont qu'une infime partie de la vie. </p><p>À un niveau plus bas : les tendances. Des modèles qui se répètent.</p><p>En dessous, ce sont les systèmes, les paradigmes et les <strong>cools</strong>.</p><p>L’iceberg entier a la forme d’un navet. Plus on s’enfonce vers les racines, plus on a de poids. Il faut exercer une pression à la base — au niveau de nos valeurs, de nos hypothèses et de nos croyances les plus ancrées — pour provoquer un changement significatif et durable.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/602ef1f4aaaec88046156073_cools_pyramid_450x578.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Nous sommes en train de nous rendre compte que le monde fonctionne sur une poignée de préceptes largement incontestés.</p><p>La majorité d’entre nous tiennent pour acquis que les économistes savent ce qu’ils font.

Que la publicité est inoffensive. Que la confidentialité est une partie normale de la démocratie. Que le commerce des armes ne peut pas être arrêté. Que, quel que soit le crime odieux commis par une société, elle est intouchable. </p><p>Mais maintenant, pris dans une crise existentielle sans issue évidente, nous commençons à remettre en question ces coordonnées cachées de notre réalité et à réfléchir à un nouveau système d’opération pour la planète Terre.

Vos données deviennent une partie de votre personne. Par la suite, nous lançons la Coalition Libération Mentale (CLM) et nous commençons à reprendre notre espace mental par force — en piratant le système et en manipulant les algorithmes qui nous manipulent.</em></p><p><em>Sur le plan écologique, nous prenons la main invisible d’Adam Smith pour travailler avec nous au lieu de contre nous. Nous réalisons une réforme capitaliste — une évolution douloureuse, mais nécessaire vers un nouveau type de marché mondial où le prix de chaque produit nous informe de sa vérité écologique.</em></p><p><em>Sur le plan des entreprises, on lance un boycottage jamais vu, contre l’une des entreprises les plus criminelles du monde — ExxonMobil — et on la fait disparaitre de la surface de la Terre. Une fois que la plus puissante sera tombée, les autres suivront et un Mouvement de Révocation de la Charte des Entreprises verra le jour.</em></p><p><em>Sur le plan financier, nous obligeons nos dirigeants à éliminer tous les paradis fiscaux. Nous marchons dans le monde entier pour une taxe Robin des Bois de 1% sur toutes les transactions boursières et monétaires. Nous faisons pression pour que de nouveaux règlements soient mis en place pour refroidir la fièvre folle de la négociation par robot. Nous proposons une idée élégante : il faut conserver une action pendant 24 heures après son achat avant de la vendre.</em></p><p><em>Sur le front économique, nous mettons en place des cellules subversives dans les départements d'économie des universités du monde entier, et nous commençons à perturber les cours, à placarder des affiches et à clouer des manifestes Kick It Over sur les portes des professeurs. Nous dénonçons la science économique actuelle comme une profession nuisant, désastreusement déréglée. Nous réalisons un saut révolutionnaire dans la pensée économique — un changement de paradigme vers un nouveau modèle qui fonctionne dans le monde réel.</em></p><p><em>Sur le plan politique, nous rendons le secret tabou dans tous les domaines de la sécurité nationale, sauf les plus délicats. Nous mettons un frein au commerce des armes. Nation après nation, nous adoptons des amendements constitutionnels exigeant des référendums dans lesquels aucune guerre ne peut être déclenchée sans l'assentiment de la majorité du peuple.</em></p><p><em>Sur le plan esthétique, nous transformons le ton ambiant du monde. Nous sortons de la ligne droite impie et immorale sur laquelle nous sommes coincés depuis un siècle et apprenons à vaciller à nouveau.</em></p><p>Grâce à ces transformations métamémétiques, nous remettons notre expérience sur la planète Terre sur une voie saine et durable.</p><p>*</p><p>À ce stade, certains d'entre vous pensent que c'est de la folie, de l’impossible.

Edgar Hoover. But no one saw that letter, or even knew it existed. The government’s secret campaign to hamstring the civil-rights movement by taking out its leader only came to light after <em id="""">The New York Times</em> smoked that letter out in 2014. Want to know more? You can’t. All materials surrounding the case have been ordered sealed until 2027.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Democracy is the defining virtue of Western political systems. We worry that if it fails we’ve got nothing. That’s why what’s happening now is so troubling. Democracy seems to be on the verge of failing. We’re stuck in a political deadlock.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">But the real glue in the gears of democracy isn’t what you think. It isn’t the lack of a third party that will do things differently. It isn’t apathy that keeps folks from voting, or fear of arrest that keeps them from protesting.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">It’s secrecy.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Somehow, we’ve let transparency fall away as an essential pillar of democracy. And in its place is secrecy, from the highest levels on down. Every corner of government, from trade pacts to grand-jury deliberations to the daily goings-on at the White House and the Pentagon and the CIA and the NSA is flat-out infested with an ethic of secrecy. Secrecy has become so commonplace that what should have been jaw-dropping geopolitical developments have passed us by, unnoticed:</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Most of the wars of the 20th and 21st centuries were hatched in secret. Many of the dictators and strongmen of the past century were secretly propped up by Western governments. Almost all genocides and government-afflicted atrocities were orchestrated in secret.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">If World War Three erupts, secrecy will almost certainly be the accelerant that ignites it.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">How did we let this happen? Because you can be sure that baked-in secrecy was never the plan for the United States. In fact, just the opposite was true.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Secrecy was never in the American playbook</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Secrecy has been around since the beginning of time, the refuge of scoundrels, schemers and swines. It’s how tribal leaders, kings and emperors maintained control. Even the American Constitution was written in secret — deliberations were kept private so that delegates wouldn’t censor themselves. But the Framers also made sure checks on abuse of power were baked into the document. One of the first things they did was enshrine protection for whistleblowers. “We, the people” would have an ear to the door. And for a century and a half any governmental attempts to draw the blinds always met fierce pushback.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">But come World War II, when “national security” concerns trumped all else, a culture of secrecy crept in. The newly minted adjective “classified” meant: “designated as officially secret: accessible only to authorized people.” What kind of things were “classified”? Vital intelligence matters, military plans, weapons technology, the names of informants overseas.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">And then — here’s where the real trouble started — the definition began to broaden. Routine bureaucratic business began to be classified. Even humdrum exchanges started being given one of the four labels that Truman created by executive order as the Cold War bit in: “Top Secret.” “Secret,” “Confidential” and “Restricted.” There was always a reason to use one of those stamps, just to be safe. Government claimed the right to hold sensitive meetings <em id="""">in camera</em> – and everything was arguably sensitive.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">And even after the Cold War was over, secrecy remained, a habit now. The blinds stayed down after the Communist threat was gone.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">And they’re still down. Truman’s “classified” stamp isn’t some last-resort tool, accessible by a select few top executives to be used in a five-alarm emergency where national-security-interests trump the powerful, constitutionally protected imperative for transparency. Nope. Today, more than five million people in the US have the authority to “classify” information. Since the Nixon era it has become a reflex to classify anything remotely controversial. When the Moynihan Commission into Government Secrecy looked into this in 1994, it found epidemic government ovrreach. More than 1.5 <em id="""">billion</em> records, dating back 25 years, remained inaccessible.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">And things never got better after that. They got worse. In 2014 alone an astonishing 77.5 million documents were classified. Today, if you get your hands on a document through the Freedom of Information Act, chances are it’ll look like a blackout poem — heavily redacted, with entire paragraphs or pages smoked out. That is the smoke of arrogance. And that smoke becomes more and more toxic as secrecy scales up to the highest levels of government.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">*</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">America started the Viet Nam war under false pretenses. The triggering incident — the August 4, 1964 attack on a US destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin — never happened. There were no enemy torpedoes, only an overzealous sonar operator chasing ghosts. But that soldier’s erroneous report was the excuse President Johnson needed to persuade Congress to authorize the war. He knew the truth. Defense secretary Robert S McNamara knew the truth. The only ones who didn’t know the truth were the American people. And they would have no clue until Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers seven years and a couple of million needless deaths later. After that a new verb entered the world. To be “McNamara’d” meant to be snowed.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Americans have been getting royally McNamara’d ever since.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">In 2019, attorney general William Barr McNamara’d the American people by using secrecy, redaction and carefully orchestrated strategic delays in releasing Robert Mueller’s report. The result was that most Americans thought that Trump had somehow been exonerated.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Imagine if Mueller’s report — plus Trump’s tax returns — had been released immediately in full for all to see (and why the fuck not?). Then Trump’s, election, impeachment and presidency may have unfolded very differently.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Imagine if transparency, rather than secrecy, had been America’s operating system from the get-go. If we’d stuck by the framers’ guns and made secrecy taboo.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">How might the progress of civil rights changed had the government not been able to hide its tracks? How might America’s trajectory changed had the government’s covert counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) — which targeted such dangerous subversives as feminists, peaceniks and the Black Power Movement — not been allowed to rumble undetected and unimpeded for a quarter century?</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">No Viet Nam war.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">No Iraq war.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Indeed, most wars anywhere would never have happened if we the people knew what was really going on.

The hammer is, of course, national security. But secrecy on the highest levels of national security — things like nuclear codes, the names of undercover agents, the details of hostage negotiations — are a tiny, tiny percentage of the material the government believes is too hot for you, child.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">We hear that Grand Jury deliberations have to be secret to shield the unjustly accused. Trade Deals have to be secret to keep their delicate socio-political engineering from being blown apart. Corruption investigations have to be secret to keep the targets from finding out they’re in the crosshairs.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">These are mostly red herrings. The real reason so many public and corporate proceedings are classified isn’t for safety or national security interests. It’s to shield the actors and institutions from embarrassment and accountability. To let them cover their butts. Secrecy is now mostly just a way for the people in power to hide their dirty laundry and to push through what they want to push through, with no resistance. It’s the rotten smell that now pervades our entire commercial, diplomatic and information systems.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">A second justification of secrecy you sometimes here is this: <em id="""">The glue of society is trust, and trust depends on certain information being kept “in confidence.” No privacy, no freedom.</em></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">That’s true but irrelevant. Yes, you need to be able to trust your psychiatrist or priest or rabbi to keep your most private unburdenings in confidence. But privacy owed to individuals is different from secrecy claimed by elected officials. Chronic secret-keeping keeps cultures, like people, from moving into the future.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Radical transparency: Capstone of the Citizen Sovereignty Movement</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">I still remember the day, in 2010, when Julian Assange leaked those US army intelligence documents about the Baghdad airstrikes on Wikileaks. Thousands of pages of hot government secrets. And then, proving he was not to be cowed by cease-and-desist threats, he posted more incriminating documents, including Baghdad and Afghanistan war logs.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Wikileaks had introduced<em id=""""> the possibility of meaningful accountability.</em></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">I thought: “Now we’re getting somewhere . . . now our political system will heave.”</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">But it didn’t.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Three years later, Edward Snowden, a contractor working for the National Security Agency, encountered what he believed to be unconstitutional surveillance of American citizens, and he too went public.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">This is why the framers enshrined whistleblower protection into the constitution just months after America was born. The whistleblower is the foot soldier of democracy. It’s only through the work of whistleblowers and informants that we come to know what we don’t know.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">But we now know what happens to whistleblowers when they stick their neck out. There’s every chance you get chased to Russia, a la Snowden, never to be seen again.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">So it takes incredible courage. But here’s the thing: it should not be up to some brave individual to step up and shine the light on systemic institutional violence. It’s the person who hides vital information who should be rotting in jail.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">*</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">In this information age, where gigatons of information zip around the globe each second, and where the geopolitical, financial and ecological stakes are so high, we clearly need a new guaranteed human right. One that is stamped into the first article of every state constitution. One that needs to become the centerpiece of the United Nations Charter. The right to government transparency. Capstone of the movement toward Citizen Sovereignty.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Only when We the People know what’s going on can this truly be called a democracy. Because <em id="""">the right to freely express yourself depends first on the ability to make an informed judgment.</em> That’s what “power to the people” means. Not just the power to exercise your vote and to air your grievances in peaceful demonstrations, but to do these things from a position of strength. Knowledge is strength. The right to act begins with the right to know.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Secrecy is how the powerful abuse their power, and hold on to that power when they’d otherwise be tossed out on their cans if the people knew the truth. The sword of scoundrels is information asymmetry. There’s something the government knows that the people don’t. When transparency is restored and the asymmetry is removed, citizens become sovereign. And cultures pull themselves back from the brink of self-annihilation.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Because secrecy is more poisonous than facts. It’s secrecy that causes paranoia to run rampant and hate to spread and pressure to build. The best way to avoid World War III is to have no classified information, no top-secret documents, no redaction, no secret channels, no deep state.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Changing the tone</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">There’s a variant of the card game bridge called “contract bridge.” In it, everyone, at every table, plays the same hand. At the end you know who the best bridge players are. They’re the ones who made the most of what everybody had. The players who lose in these conditions are likely to accept the results.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">If we can agree that everyone having their cards on the table is important, then that changes everything. Because the dynamic that unfolds when some people are in the dark is predictable. The frustration hatches shortterm stabs at solutions. A Pirate Party or a Syriza or Podemos springs up. But ultimately nothing changes and the tension ratchets up until finally something truly pernicious happens and a gasket blows in the machine. People say fuck it! And spill out into the streets in massive, often violent, protest. The rage is because people have been pushed outside the forum where decisions are made. They <em id="""">have</em> no agency. They have no option but to swing a hammer. They have to smash their way inside City Hall. But when the doors to City Hall are thrown open, the fury of that storm dissipates.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Here’s the other thing about free-flowing information: it works. In the long run it’s the only thing that works. It works at the level of nations for the same reason that it works for individuals. It’s a good idea to come clean with your lawyer or your psychiatrist or your spouse. If you don’t, your secrets will bite you in the long run. In the same way that honesty that is the key to personal liberty, it’s also the key to democratic liberty.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">When people feel empowered, they behave differently. The psychological power balance between top &amp; bottom of society is shattered.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Every major social movement of the last century is at least partly an attempt to expose a rot born of secrecy. People suffer in silence because someone powerful is covering something up (because if the extent of the problem was known, there would be hell to pay). Until they don’t. #MeToo was the explosion of a problem that had been contained by secrecy: someone in power leveraged the shame of a secret over someone less powerful. What is #BlackLivesMatter but a reaction to the open “secret” of institutionalized racism – the mass denial of a grossly rigged game? When brutality is never known unless someone happens to witness it and publish the footage, when police bodycam footage isn’t surrendered until there’s a loud enough hue and cry, that’s a recipe for a bomb. This is all just about secrets. There need to be mechanisms to force those secrets out into the open. And hold the feet of the secret-keepers to the fire.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">#MakeSecrecyTaboo — Towards a World Without Secrecy</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">It’s unconscionable that it’s the victims of secrets who feel shame – too much shame to come forward with their grievances.

We the people would actually be able to intervene at critical deadlock points. There’s no evidence that trade deals cooked up in secret are any better.

Nat Turner's Rebellion: Echoes of Resistance from Virginia to Gaza,nat-turner-rebellion,65c28f6b17c6d6d0d042a41c,6620142c31f6a055f454caf4,false,false,Wed Apr 17 2024 18:25:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Apr 18 2024 22:09:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Nov 05 2024 00:01:07 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),false,"<p id="""">Nat Turner was born in Virginia in 1800, the son of slaves and the property of plantation owners.</p><p id="""">His rebellion, which was launched August 21, 1831, and lasted two days and two nights, saw the killing of some fifty-five white men, women, and children, some (including the family of the man who owned him) in their sleep. To begin with, the rebels numbered just six besides Turner, but by the end they had recruited sixty to their cause. The plan was to go from plantation to plantation, house to house, blazing a trail of terror on their way to the county seat, where Turner aimed to raid the armory for weapons and ammunition. Today the seat of Southampton County is known as Courtland, but back then it was called — what else? — Jerusalem.</p><p id="""">Turner's rebels never reached Jerusalem. They were met by white militias just a few miles away and either captured or killed. In the frenzy that followed, some three dozen Black people were slain in extrajudicial killings. Thirty were tried before a panel of slaveholding judges and condemned to death, though twelve later had their sentences commuted. Turner remained a fugitive for almost two months before he was caught and hanged on November 11, 1831.</p><p id="""">A day before the first convicted rebel was executed, William Lloyd Garrison, the publisher of the abolitionist paper <em id="""">The Liberator</em>, wrote:</p><p id=""""><em>True, the rebellion is quelled. Yet laugh not in your carnival of crime Too proudly, ye oppressors! You have seen, it is to be feared, but the beginning of sorrows.</em></p><p id="""">He goes on to warn supporters of the pro-slavery cause not to seek satisfaction in the display of retributive violence. Wielding the country's overwhelming military might — ""the power to kill <em id="""">all</em>,"" as he calls it — either in revenge or as a deterrent against future slave revolts can only lead to the intensification of the conditions that motivated Turner's to begin with. It is a cycle of violence that, without being broken, will inevitably end in ""a war of extermination."" Written thirty years before the outbreak of the Civil War, in which as many as 750,000 Americans died to settle the matter of slavery, this insight is stunning.</p><p id="""">In some white liberals' thirst ""to apply the whip and forge new fetters,"" Garrison saw a deadly double standard. Isn't it enough to imagine the revolters ""dripping with warm blood fresh from their lacerated bodies"" to understand that their acts weren't committed in a vacuum? He railed against these ""fustian declaimers for liberty"" and ""valiant sticklers for equal rights"" who talk up the cause of freedom where it concerns ""Frenchmen, Greeks, and Poles"" (heroes of popular freedom fights), yet who side with the slaveholders against the oppressed in their own country. After all, it isn't just ""in their stripes — in their emaciated bodies — in their ceaseless toil"" that the enslaved find reason to rise up. It can be found ""wherever you and your fathers have fought for liberty — in your speeches, your conversations, your celebrations, your pamphlets, your newspapers.""

The key, I’ve concluded, is novelty. Whether it’s true, as the ethobotanist and psychonaut Terence McKenna claimed, that the pursuit of novelty is “the only one way to live a truly progressive life,” it’s a mighty tempting strategy to air out. “From a species perspective, the job of each individual is to be unlike anyone who’s living or who ever lived,” McKenna wrote. “To do things, and react to things, in a way no one has quite done before.”&nbsp;</p><p id="""">This is of course pretty much an act of cultural treason. There’s a reason <em id="""">Atomic Habits </em>was a #1 world bestseller and nobody has written <em id="""">Atomic Novelty</em>. Habits are safe. Flout them and people in charge start furrowing their brows, because now you’re likely to start breaking rules, too. Even the rules of the universe? Many smart people claim we don’t actually have free will, even though it feels like we do. I decided to engineer a day that tests that discouraging premise — a day where you chase free will around, trying to outfox it. The experiment wouldn’t really prove anything one way or the other. But it might yield some ... unexpected returns.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Humans have around 60,000 thoughts every day. The bad news is that ninety five percent of them are the same thoughts we had yesterday. That’s good to know, because now you can strategize. You can step down, a little, from the brute repetition, by pledging to deliberately zig when your first thought is to zag. To try to wrong-foot the universe by calling audiblesat every turn. To disrupt patterns as they form. To catch yourself about to do something and then instead do the opposite, like Truman Burbank exposing the charade he has discovered his life to be, maybe catching a glimpse of the stagehand who’s hanging the moon in the sky. You are basically REWILDING YOUR ATTENTION by tuning into what one aleatory argonaut called “the true essence of things.”&nbsp;</p><p id="""">There are people who take a formal approach to this venture. They call themselves “randonauts.” One, a former Google software engineer named Max Hawkins, pushes the conceit to an extreme. Building, a half-century later, on a minor 1970s-era craze of “dicing” (inspired by this novel) and by the <em id="""">I Ching </em>(the ancient Chinese divination text), a few thousand years earlier, Hawkins started off by using a random-number generator to pick his evening social events. Then he began turning all of his decision-making over to a randomness app he built. There are a lot of benefits to living like this, among them plausible deniability — if it turns out badly, well ... blame the dice! Many years ago, when I wrote for the alternative press, my wingman and I gave ourselves a challenge in the same spirit. There was a map of the city on the wall. We had to throw a dart and write a publishable story about the exact spot the dart landed. (Regretfully, we never really followed through on this conceit.)&nbsp;</p><p id="""">For today, for this experiment, I decided to raw-dog it. Just set out early and trust my instincts. No apps, no dice, no darts, no random-number- generator spitting out homing co-ordinates. Only the second brain in my gut, that billion-nerve knot.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">“Flaneur mode,” if you will.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Remember those folks? The flaneurs were free spirits who strode the streets of Paris in the Sixties, giving themselves over to what the Situationists (an experimental performance-art movement) called “the derive.” Derive means “drift,” and that’s what you do: you simply bob about, guided by your own unconscious. You carry on, “letting the day breathe,” as the vagabonding travel writer Rolf Potts puts it, “until something interesting happens.” And because your mind is parked in the receptive and open position, it inevitably does. Random exploration seems, somehow, to seed the clouds with possibility.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">When you’re in flaneur mode, as philosopher Walter Benjamin (a big-time fan of the derive) phrased it, you are “storing time in a battery.” Really, this is a prescription to recharge your very soul; you are a sniff for what resonates deep within you. I once had a colleague who claimed the only way to break the consumerist trance is to do things that make no sense. Jeff was channeling the poet Basho, who said: ‘When you don’t know what to do ... the answer is: Go climb Mt. Fuji.” Flaneuring your way through a day forces you into being surprised by what you encounter. It’s like what Proust said is the essence of travel: it isn’t really about getting from one place to another. It’s about trying to see the world with new eyes.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">People plan their lives to the hilt. But to my mind the true gift, the real jam, is in the opportunity to embrace, and relish, what we did not choose. “Uncertainty is actually much more pleasurable,” David Krakauer, the chief&nbsp; scientist of the Santa Fe Institute, told science writer Christie Aschwanden not long ago. Uncertainty is the great moment-to-moment thrill of science, art, all human endeavor.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">And so. A day of CONCENTRATED UNCERTAINTY awaits.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Ready?</p><p id="""">Let’s cabbage.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">It’s not yet 9 am but traffic is already thickening near English Bay as we cut our way through the city. The girls are out of town, so it’s just Penny and me. Penny’s our golden retriever. Luckily, she had no other plans.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">The trick, I have decided, is to get into a kind of Zen frame of mind from the get-go. “Set out early and never arrive,” as the writer Marty Rubin defined the ideal journey. Ideally, one has already, as Yoko Ono advised, drawn up “a map to get lost.” We had no map, just a vague idea of heading south and following our nose.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">City traffic, which can feel like a long unbroken river of steel when you’re in it, is actually just a bunch of congo lines moving from stoplight to stoplight.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">You can see that from the air; even at rush hour the roads are mostly uncongested, except for the places where they hellaciously are. Bicyclists didn’t worry about any of this. They breeze down Beach Avenue, around<br>the vast wide European-style dedicated lanes the city installed during the pandemic and just left there. Something has happened to my city while I was holed up on the North Shore, waiting for the pasta to boil. It underwent a retrofit. It became a human-powered city. Maybe Copenhagen. For once it’s not the driver who feels the privilege and the human-powered folk who are put upon, but the other way around.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">I spot a piece of public art on the waterfront that looks worth investigating, and start ratholing through the West End alleys, looking for parking. There’s a cool story about the Naskapi First Nations of far Northern Ontario and Quebec. The Naskapi are a hunting and foraging people. Their main source of food is the caribou. When deciding where to look for caribou, the Naskapi hunters use a divination ritual: they heat a caribou bone — typically a shoulder blade — over hot coals, until cracks and spots start to appear on it. “The resulting pattern is used as a map.” (This from the anthropologist Joseph Henrich in his book <em id="""">The Secret of Our Success</em>.)&nbsp;</p><p id="""">This sounds like pure madness. A Naskipi elder had to explain to a skeptical researcher what was going on. Here’s something you may not understand about hunting caribou, the elder said: if you visit one location too often, the caribou know to stay away. The best hunting strategy therefore requires complete randomization. That’s something very hard for people to voluntarily gin up. It’s hard to do something for no reason. We can’t resist imposing our ingenuity – a fatal move if you’re hunting caribou. To take hubris out of play, the Naskapi fall back on this seemingly loopy, wobbly, mindless tradition of pure chance. And that’s what saves them.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">I wonder if the same logic could apply to hunting for a parking spot in Vancouver’s West End. It ought not to work... but it does!&nbsp;</p><p id="""">The dog and I hop out. We’ve overshot the art by quite a bit. We cross Beach Avenue and just kind of stand there. Scouting.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Penny looks at me like, What’s the plan?&nbsp;</p><p id="""">We haven’t got a plan, I tell her with my eyes. That’s the point.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Everyone engages with Penny first. Because she is a babe. I am an afterthought. In the gap, I take a little intentional nonjudgmental pause, to “take the knee-jerk out of the knee-jerk,” as the neuroscientist Beau Lotto puts it. Those first thoughts/beliefs that naturally arise, psychologist Ellen Langer calls those “pre- cognitive commitments,” and you can wait them out, until you are standing there with more or less a beginner’s mind, ready to think something different. This is what appealed to a lot of the early derive: the derive was thought to be a creativity machine, a tool to jar loose wacky new ideas.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Some folks are taking a group picture in front of the giant stone Inukshuk. “Would you like to be in the picture?” I say to the picture taker. It occurs to me, while framing it up, that a very Canadian thing to have happen right now would be for something to now tap me on the shoulder and say, “Would you like to be in the picture?” and before I could explain I was a actually just a passing-by stranger, the group would smilingly go, ‘Come on, come in,’ and I’d fold into the mix, and the picture taker would ready the shot, and then someone would tap that guy on the shoulder, and so on, and so on. That’d be so Canadian.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">This does not happen, though.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Penny and I futz around a bit on the beach.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">We are following nobody’s footsteps. But we are on a well-trod path more generally. The ancient Greeks were all about these kinds of no-goal, Socratic walks. It didn’t matter where you were going; it only mattered where the conversation was going. More recently, Baudelaire pinballed through Paris, and Henry James through Rome, guided by accident. So, there is precedent for these shenanigans. Is there a future in it? Recently, the engineer and writer James Bridle tried to build a private self-driving car that gets as lost as he does. He trained the car to lose track of its initial co-ordinates, “to collaborate in the production of new unforeseen outcomes.” Not a smart car, then, but a crazy-like-a-fox car. To Bridle’s mind, getting lost is always the more interesting option.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">What actually drives ... one’s behavior when there is no road map for the day? The pull of intuition? Or is it more of a deliberate suppression of first-order thoughts and acts? The neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says he tries, 20 or 30 times a day, to deliberately hit the brakes on what he was about to reflexively do – even if that thing was just answering the phone. He calls it training up the brain’s “no go” circuitry. This “active imposition of discipline” imposes a sense of control over your life. It feels good. It relieves stress.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">But in a way I think my experiment is the opposite of that. It’s about giving up control, releasing yourself into the flow. Which also feels good, in a different way. “I think intention and willpower are highly overrated,”&nbsp;</p><p id="""">June Huh, math professor at Princeton and winner of the Fields medal, told an interviewer recently. “You rarely achieve anything with those things.” Huh finds that forcing himself to do something or defining a specific goal — even for something he enjoys — “never works.”&nbsp;</p><p id="""">It does seem true that each little defeat of the well-grooved neural algorithms, seems to stir up something ... not so much discrete new thoughts but a new feeling, a new vibe. Maybe even a new plane of existence? In the film <em id="""">Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em>, people can only “verse jump” – skip to a different groove in the multiverse – by doing something statistically improbable, forcing themselves off the prescribed path.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Back in the car, still in this multiverse as far as I can tell, we head across the Cambie Bridge, through Cedar Cottage (cuz we like the name) and eventually fetch up in Mt. Pleasant cemetery, for no reason than I just remembered that some Titanic survivors are buried here.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">I let Penny off leash so she can roll in the freshly mown grass. She soon picks up a scent, and I ... just let her go. Now she was taking me for a walk. This is a dodge the French journalist Joel Henry, co-editor of the <em id="""">Lonely Planet Guide to Experimental Travel</em>, called Dog’s Leg Travel: “Let&nbsp; yourself be led by what interests the dog.” Apparently what we are both doing now is of interest to the officer in the dog-bylaw van, who had been waiting all morning to make a collar. He strides over. Takes us in for a few seconds. Then he hands me a ticket.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">As he drives away, a neighbor who had been watching the whole thing go down from her porch comes over, furious about this petty- fascist application of the letter of the law. I show her the ticket. It isn’t a ticket. It’s a list of Vancouver’s off-leash parks. The cop who could have ticketed me instead has told me where to go — in the nicest possible<br>way. The fury drains out of this woman’s face now. It’s as if her whole city has been redeemed.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">In the terrific Ben Lerner short story “The Ferry,” a man has dropped his son off at school and is taking the subway home. And in this mundane moment the world, or his experience of it, kind of becomes enchanted. It is as if he is in a story. Everything he encounters was carefully chosen. The ticket machine in the Metro that asks him, “Do you want more value or more time?” The cracked mirror that someone has put out on the sidewalk, offered for free (“Still works!”). The whole world has become Chekhovian. The universe has been speaking in a code; it’s still not solved but suddenly feels solvable.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">We head further west. The Mazda wants to turn on Brunswick, so we do.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Something’s going on up ahead. The smell of Mexican gorditas wafting from a food truck draws us in to a crowded park.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">There’s a philosopher named Byung-Chul Han who has a theory about smell: it has a kind of superpower — it slows time. Smell, he observes, is the only sense you can’t fast-forward through. Video, audio you can capture and double-x; even touch you can hustle along in your imagination. But smell’s right here now or it’s nowhere. It’s got you. From this, for Byung- Chul, a kind of life philosophy emerges, a kind of hymn to slow: “it’s the experience of duration that counts in life, not the number of experiences.” Staccato vanishes like firecrackers, adagio sticks.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">The Mount Pleasant Sunday Farmer’s Market is in full rhubarb and Penny and I make the rounds. An earnest young environmental activist asks if I’d consider signing a petition, and we’re soon in a spirited discussion about fracking (is it all the devil’s work, or is fracking for, say, geothermal energy ok?) and I end up with the organization’s card in my pocket, like a promissory note.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Nearby, a guy sitting in front of a sculpture known as “Dude Chilling” notices mid-vape that I’m about to take a photo, and obligingly moves out of the frame. (Though this is the opposite of what I was hoping for; I don’t want to change this moment in the park by my presence, I want to fold into it.) I remember once being given a neat piece of advice: over the next 24 hours, every time something happens within you or out in the world that could upset you, shift into expecting it to be exactly as it is. Tell yourself it is exactly as it is supposed to be. Maybe this is what Rumi was getting at. He once proposed an experiment: for a whole day, “live as if life is rigged in your favor.”&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Today is starting to feel like that. It occurs to me that if one were to do this for long enough, this Pottsian vagabonding, this Proustian psychogeography, this strolling through life as a “passionate spectator,” setting up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the fugitive and the infinite” (as Edgar Allen Poe put it), one might well, eventually, and without benefit of psychoactive drugs, pass through a door of perception into a genuinely bizarre set of circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Poe’s short story “The Man of the Crowd” begins with the narrator parked in a cafe watching folks pass by through the rain-streaked window. Each stranger is lost in thought, alone in their bubble, fighting their own private battles, but one “decrepit old man” seems to carry an extra level of inscrutability. The narrator gets up and follows this man. For the rest of the evening the narrator shadows him through the streets of London. There’s no rhyme or reason to his quarry’s route or behavior; he walks into shops and leaves without ever buying anything. He seems to float, to drift. There’s a sinister air of cover-up to him. What’s he hiding? Is&nbsp;that a dagger under his cloak? The next day the narrator, tired and exasperated, he goes looking for this man again. He finds him. And this time he stands directly in the man’s path, so as to knock him out of his mysterious groove. The man almost collides with him; he appears not to even see him. We are left to conclude that the narrator and the stranger are, somehow, the same person.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">With this experiment, the thing being shadowed is, explicitly, novelty itself. But “new” isn’t just synonymous with “recent.” Least of all that. True newness is seeing the newness in something that was there all along. And it may be you. *&nbsp;</p><p id="""">We thread our way home along the hem of the ocean, across the Burrard Bridge dipsy-doodling along the inlet toward Stanley Park as the light turns sweet. Attention rewilded, uncertainty concentrated. Until finally we are pulling into our own carport, no less beautiful for its familiarity.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">This whole day has consisted of what the measuring world would consider dead time – zero billable hours, nothing to put in the books. And yet it is the most alive time of all.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">There’s another Rumi quote I like:&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Live as if every single person you encounter has been sent as a guide.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Each conversation today was way more interesting for that quote having been parked the back of my mind: the anti-fracking guy, the woman in the cemetery, the fellow with the canoe on his car on the outskirts of Pacific Spirit Park, where Penny and I ambled under the towering hemlocks and firs, choosing our route by the names of the paths. None of these strangers came on like Obi-wan Kenobi (though Canoe Guy did speak eloquently of the value, at a time like this, of pursuing tranquility). But pretty much all of them left a little mark on the cave wall.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">It’s like that old saying: “Even when you dial the wrong number there’s someone at the other end.” You could even say, there are no wrong numbers.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">All these things happened because I had nowhere else to be.

Even as it was turning us against each other, and most of us were slowly kind of becoming the opposite of free.</p><p id="""">So now you ask yourself: What else am I mindlessly taking for granted?</p><p id="""">The green-energy revolution will magically science us out of global warming.</p><p id="""">Our leaders know what they're doing.</p><p id="""">Global democracy is safe, it will prevail.</p><p id="""">Here's another fiction many of us are holding on to: massive, seismic systemic change is not something that can happen in our lifetimes.</p><p id="""">We know that major disruptions have happened, but these are events far away in time and place ... when circumstances were different, power structures fragile enough to topple, etc. It's hard to accept that such an event might be coming for us. It's a bit like allowing we could be in a fatal car crash tomorrow. At some level we know it's possible. But we kind of refuse to ... let it land.</p><p id="""">There are places our minds just do not want to go.</p><p id="""">Because: fear.</p><p id="""">There's a quote by Mark Fisher that you hear a lot. It's basically Frederick Jameson's with a twist:</p><p id="""">It's easier to imagine the end of capitalism than what comes after.</p><p id="""">It's that ""what comes after"" that's crazy-making. What IS on the other side of this consumer-capitalist experiment? Chaos? Anarchy?</p><p id="""">Or worse (gasp): socialism.</p><p id="""">The examples of socialism that pop to mind are disastrous distortions of a workable template, totalitarian Leftist states with tyrants at the helm (Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot), and catastrophic suffering the by-product. This alternative to capitalism just seems evil. For many Americans, trying to imagine a kind of democratic socialism that works ... well, it's just about impossible. There are no hand holds on that rock face.</p><h1 id="""">II. ""Wild Problems""</h1><p id="""">Would we be better off if we dumped capitalism? That is what economists call a ""wild problem.""</p><p id="""">Wild problems are ones we have no real idea of how to think about. We can't get our minds around them because we've never encountered them before. There's no playbook. There's no way to PROVE which decision is the right one. No straight-line analysis is going to cut it. No experts are standing by to settle the matter. Rationality can't help you; it may in fact hurt you. You can't logic out a wild problem. When you try, you just end up looking ridiculous.</p><p id="""">In the archive of Charles Darwin's papers is a hilarious account of him trying to decide whether to get married. He drew up a cost-benefit analysis. ""His list of pluses and minuses — especially the pluses — is the list that someone would make who has never been married and has no access to the upside of the inner life of a married man,"" as the economist Russ Roberts put it in his book Wild Problems. (minuses: ""degradation!"" Pluses: ""chitchat"") So ""each fork of the decision was a mystery.""</p><p id="""">What we're talking about here is judgment calls. There's no right answer AND the stakes are high.</p><p id="""">These are the decisions that define us as humans.</p><h1 id="""">III. Setting the Course</h1><p id="""">We don't know exactly what this new way of life we're going to need to adopt will look like. So if we don't know where we're going how do we proceed?</p><p id="""">By setting the co-ordinates of the way we want to feel. Free. Calm. Interconnected. Part of something bigger than ourselves.</p><p id="""">How do we build a world where everyone gets a shot at qualities like that?</p><p id="""">In the arena of wild problems, we are, each of us, in a sense, on our own. All we have to navigate by is our own morals – what the Duke political scientist Mike Munger calls our ""metaprinciples."" These are the sum total of wisdom gained through every decision we've ever made, and the feedback we've taken to make adjustments that feel right.</p><p id="""">Most people would call it ""doing the right thing."" Not overthinking it, just doing it.</p><p id="""">In the case of this new way to live that we're trying to build, we might intuit that it's putting the brakes on greed and gluttony and metastatic growth. It means sucking it up and sacrificing, to keep the circle whole for the children of our children.</p><p id="""">We intuit that there is a game within the game, here, and this one has no formal rules, no timeline and no judge. It is the real game, and it is governed by rules of the human heart.</p><p id="""">Our only guide is our intuition.</p><p id="""">Intuition is actually a powerful operating system. It was wired into us by evolution. ""Evolution selected for making the right choices, or at a minimum not making bad choices,"" as Munger puts it. ""The feeling that something is just right, or is just wrong, even if you can't say why, cannot be dismissed.""</p><p id="""">Intuition runs on emotion. And in the end, it's emotion, not facts, that changes human minds en masse.</p><p id="""">In the 1970s, as acid rain became a phenomenon of growing concern Friends of the Earth bought a billboard in Times Square, and covered it with litmus paper. After a rainy spell, the billboard turned blood red. It was a holy-crap moment. Up till that moment acid rain was an abstract idea that most people were arms-length from. Now it was real. Many look back on that as a hinge-point for environmentalists. Many people already knew the facts; now they felt the truth of it in their bones.</p><p id="""">So this is the case for saying, in effect, fuck it, I know that this shift to a new way of living is the right thing to do. I have surmised it, based on everything I've heard, and lived, and read, and is now bubbling up within me. And I hope and trust that I'm not alone in this. That others are coming to the same conclusion.</p><h1 id="""">IV. The Tipping Point</h1><p id="""">In any social system there eventually comes a point when a critical mass of people kind of ""get it,"" all that the same time. It can happen at a result of what economists call an ""information cascade."" A bunch of people were quietly sitting on their private feelings that something here is messed up. They didn't act on those feelings because they thought they were the only ones feeling them.</p><p id="""">But then they discover that they're in fact NOT alone, that tons of people feel the way they do. And this confirmation, this social proof, wrenches from a whole population a collective aha. Suddenly, private knowledge (something everyone ""knows"" but has been too timid to say) becomes public knowledge, an accepted TRUTH. The guileless kid pipes up: Hey, the king's naked! That is how the murderous authoritarian tyrant is finally deposed. Or a system that everyone went along with, but nobody believed was working anymore, is overturned.</p><p id="""">What we're talking about here is a leap of faith ... at scale.</p><p id="""">Until recently, any form of socialism was anathema to the vast majority of people in America and other wealthy nations. Even the word made folks uneasy. It was simply beyond the pale, a nonstarter. Then the pandemic hit, and as governments opened their emergency kitties, many of these same people got their first taste of elements of socialism: generous unemployment insurance, moratoriums on evictions, monthly cheques that amounted to a universal basic income. This was hardly the boogeyman of folks' imaginings. There was no jackboot authoritarianism, no dreary command-economy chokehold. This didn't feel stifling. It felt ... fair. And right.</p><p id="""">This is how minds are changed. An idea too wild to engage with gets a toehold in the collective psyche. And a little crack opens in people's defenses.</p><p id="""">What happens next matters hugely.</p><p id="""">What happens next, as the Japanese economist Kohei Saito puts it, is you turn the dial. You promote modest little changes like living in a small apartment rather than a big, drafty house. Like taking the bus. Cutting back on air travel. Stopping ordering ""fundamentally useless things"" online. Working less. Walking more. Getting to know your neighbors.</p><p id="""">Multiply these actions by block and city, then notch them up to the levels of industry and state, Saito says. Tax the rich. ""Steer capital toward home care and nursing homes, not arms manufacturing. Give subsidies and water to local farms, not Big Ag. Make neighborhoods dense and walkable and dependent on public transit. Destroy the G.D.P. and the World Trade Organization, which has stifled climate-change action plans based on the argument that they violate free trade.""</p><p id="""">Now that you're genuinely entertaining an alternative, you can see the cracks in the one you had thought was inviolable. Neoliberalism. Which ""venerates the logic of the market and strips away the things that make us human.""</p><p id="""">We may not be able to fully grok a wild problem like the one we're facing. But we can learn to feel our way in the dark.</p><p id="""">The required shift here is from unfettered capitalism to something closer to democratic socialism; but this isn't really about politics. The required shift is from endless growth to a steady-state equilibrium; but this isn't about economics. No, what's being asked of us is much more intimate. This is a spiritual moment in the life of Earthlings. The transition from hoarding to sharing. From ""I"" to we.""</p><p id="""">From What is my birthright? to What is my duty?</p><p id="""">Are you ready?</p>",,— Harry Flood,"<p id="""">— Harry Flood</p>","Inventing a new way to live, one that will allow us, as a species, to go on living, is what economists call a ""wild problem.""

They were talking about a cultural disorder, not a neurological one.</p><p>The reigning neoclassical model of economics is autistic, they said. It’s so rational it’s irrational. They demanded reform within economics teaching, which they claimed had become enthralled with complex mathematical models that operate only in conditions that don’t exist.</p><p>The students were rebelling against the straw man at the center of economic science — a pathetic parody of a human being called the “Rational Utility Maximizer.” This guy runs around making perfectly predictable choices within perfectly functioning markets. He’s never depressed, never sickened by pollution, never emotional, never a dreamy wanderer, never in love.</p><p>But of course real humans are not like that. We fly off on wild tangents, have altruistic impulses, do crazy things. We feel guilty when we overindulge, get depressed when we lose our jobs, seek revenge when people do us wrong, and we often refuse to buy something just because our values don’t jibe with those of a corporation. And we routinely thwart our “rational self-interest” by pulling off remarkable feats of compassion and teamwork.</p><p>Neoclassical economics cannot handle this truth. It has achieved its coherence as a “science” by amputating most of human nature.</p><p>Three Nobel Laureates — Wassily Leontief, Ronald Close and Milton Friedman — had expressed similar concerns. “Existing economics is a theoretical system which floats in the air and which bears little relation to what happens in the real world,” complained Ronald Close. And near the end of his life, Milton Friedman conceded that the discipline had “become increasingly an arcane branch of mathematics rather than dealing with real economic problems.” The only thing that matters in science is predictive power, he said. Your models need to get better and better, in a tightening circle of accuracy. If they don’t, it’s not science. Economists roundly failed that test.</p><p>None of these warnings had any impact whatsoever on economics curriculums. Wrote Mark Blaug: “We have created a monster that is very difficult to stop.”</p><p>But the students tried. They called their movement <em>autisme-économie </em>— “post-autistic economics.” These were some of the brightest students at one of the top schools in Europe. They’d done their homework — so they were equipped to handle the blowback from the old guard (like Robert Solow from MIT, who called them “children”).</p><p>Networking over the still-budding Internet, the students spread their message: that economics has narrowed to the point where it cannot contend with real-world challenges like inequality, financial instability<br>and climate change.</p><p>Their rebellion surged after an open letter signed by a thousand of them was published in <em>Le Monde</em>. In class and in the corridors, they waved signs: “We wish to escape from imaginary worlds!” They mocked their professors’ “uncontrolled use of mathematics,” number-crunching as an end in itself. Where in our curriculum, they asked, are the alternative perspectives — the hundreds of credible intellectuals and freethinkers who offer fresh ways to explain the world, through the lens of feminism, socialism, behaviorism, even Buddhism? Where is the syncretism that’s the sign of an actual grown-up mind?</p><p>“Wake up before it’s too late!” the students shouted.</p><p>Their rebel spirit spread to Cambridge and Harvard and dozens of universities around the world. A slogan splashed on a wall on a Madrid campus summed it all up: “<em>¡La economía es de gente, no de curvas!</em>” — “Economics is about people, not curves!”<br></p><p>The post-autistic movement had its shining moment … and then, like other movements before it, it faded away.

Isn’t this how scientific progress happens, after all? You just keep doing solid experiments and publishing good work until a critical mass of evidence tips the scales, and the scientific community comes round, and the new paradigm is generally accepted, and the scientists who hatched it win the Nobel Prize, and the community settles back down, with a greater understanding now of how the world works.</p><p>This is a myth!</p><p>Thomas Kuhn, in his <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, tells us a different story . . . of how paradigm shifts really happen.

The dissenters are ignored, stonewalled, refused publication and tenure, ostracized and obstructed in every way – until tensions reach a boiling point.</p><p>Kuhn’s most profound insight is that, contrary to the way scientific progress is supposed to happen, an old paradigm cannot be replaced by evidence, facts, or “the truth” . . . it will not be thrown out because its forecasts are wrong, its policies no longer work, or its theories are proved unscientific. An old paradigm will only be replaced by a new one when a group of maverick scientists orchestrate a coup and throw the old-school practitioners out of power.</p><p><a href=""http://www.adbusters.org/full-articles/the-second-student-revolt-pt-2"">Read Part 2</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.adbusters.org/full-articles/students-of-the-world-unite-pt-4"">Read Part 4</a></p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/614bafcb10f0b5400e6d42c2_students_next_pt3_600x400.jpg,,<p>Third Force</p>,"The rich pay no taxes.

Instead of grabbing your coffee from the usual Starbucks, you pull back . . . You take a leisurely walk around your neighborhood and check out the local indie scene.

What’s the point in saving a few pennies if you trash the planet (and the tender shoots of your own soul) in innumerable, invisible little ways every day?</p><p id=""""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p id="""">The most powerful (and satisfying) impact you can have on the world (and on yourself) is in the way you handle your money affairs over a lifetime . . .</p><p id="""">So now every time you need something you do a gut check.

The whole place is designed to hook you on processed foods, destroy your health and make you fat and listless. Plus you miss out on all the good stuff in life . . . your intimate connections with the place and the people around you . . . the succulence of locally grown cherries, peaches and blackberries.

I got fed up with the Royal Bank of Canada treating me like garbage — like they were doing me this great favor. SoI went in there in an angry huff one afternoon and pulled out all my money.

That small act punched above its weight; I’ve never regretted it.I get a surge of exhilaration every time I think of that RBC manager’s face as he tried to sweet-talk me out of it . . . and the feeling of relief as I walked into VanCity where I owned a wee bit of the joint now, asa member.

The world seemed “fallen,” and amid the despair people were asking: “How should I live?” But this put them, as the magicians noted, in a perfect nothing-to-lose position of starting over — of breaking free of the bourgeois mindset and getting back to the simple world before your eyes if you could actually see it. Back ‘to the things themselves.</p><p id="""">’Heidegger was sure Descartes had led us astray. We can’t think our way out of this. We can’t get an answer to all our Whys. It’s pointless to try. Best we can do is simply wonder at the existence of the world, and our “sacred sense of being” in it. To do otherwise is to surrender to alogical nightmare brought to life.</p><p id="""">But people largely did surrender to that nightmare, very similar to one we’re at the tail end of now. People forgot how to eat, drink, talk to each other, the magicians noted. The shops became toxic wastelands. . . human relations hollow and transactional . . . the sense of time fragmented into vulgar units of seconds, minutes and hours. Death the only meaningful horizon.</p><p id="""">But a nightmare is also something you can wake up from. You can still get glimpses of ‘the things themselves,’ of an authentic way of being, the way you were before advertising pickled your neurons, easy credit destroyed your resoluteness, and maxing out your Visa card became routine. Before Western culture became so self-serving and decadent . . .</p><p id="""">You can opt out of a lot of that if you try.</p><p id="""">You can stop buying unnecessary stuff and always pay off your plastic cards every month. You can cash in your stocks and shares (if you have any) and get out of the global casino for good. You can simply throw your opulent lifestyle over the side.</p><p id=""""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p id="""">When my friend (and former Adbusters editor) James MacKinnon hatched the 100-mile diet with his partner Alisa Smith, it was an experiment built on a number: 1,500. That’s the average distance food travels to get to your plate. That’s a lot of fossil fuel just so you can enjoy strawberries in February.</p><p id="""">J and A wondered whether it was even possible, in a time of spidering superglobal supply chains, to live on food grown in your own ’hood. It was. It took some ingenuity, but they ate better and more varied meals than they had in their lives. It changed them. Not just hunting for the food but savoring the act of cooking it, and sharing it with folks who found their way into their story.</p><p id="""">You pull an apple off the tree and eat it while the natural sugars are still intact in the flesh of it. Do that a few times and it becomes absurd to ever again bite into a supermarket apple from New Zealand — even off-season, when they’re the only game in town.</p><p id="""">People got positively infected by the idea. In the UK there were proposals that a portion of every supermarket parking lot ought to be set aside for local farm stalls, and people wondered whether it’d be possible to make grocers put the number — the carbon mileage — on the price tag of the food.</p><p id="""">Some people ragged on that this whole deal was nothing but a Lefty bourgeois stunt, because who else but the privileged classes get to eat local organic food? This pisses me off — not the criticism but the fact that it’s at least partly true. Even one generation ago, as James points out, it wasn’t the rich who ate local organic food — it was the everypeople. The fact that it’s now cheaper and easier to eat a peach from Mexico than from your local farmer, these are the corpo-capitalist-driven decisions that were made long before you were born that shaped the way you live now.</p><p id="""">The other day I found this Indian farm place that sold local cherries, and I decided to pull together a super-local meal for Masako, who is failing and bedridden now.</p><p id="""">Most of it came from my garden. There were deep purple Russian potatoes I yanked from the ground with my hand. There were the Chinese flat beans I’d been experimenting with, baby pachinko-ball tomatoes. And kamaboko — fish cake — for the protein. Masako’s favorite. To cook for each other is to care for each other. The last link of the chain was guiding my spoon to Masako’s mouth.</p><p id="""">The revolution of everyday life is a circle game.</p><p id="""">There are two circles: the circle of your concerns and the circle of your actions. They move in different directions as you become a grownup. Ideally, the circle of your concerns expands until — as theBuddhists would have it — it contains every living being. The circle of your actions, meanwhile, contracts: closer and closer and closer to home.</p><p id="""">—from <a href=""https://subscribe.adbusters.org/products/a-manifesto-for-world-revolution"">Manifesto for World Revolution</a></p>",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6474f83f6ed5d8d0bbef8586_042-043.jpg,,,"I passed a guy the other day, maybe 16, 17 years old.

The illogic extends from the gas we pump into our cars to the smart phones we carry in our pockets to the Big Macs we wolf down at McDonald’s. Out of the billions and billions of transactions made every day in our global marketplace, only a tiny fraction reflect their true cost. And each one drives us a little closer to global system collapse. With every bogus transaction, another drop of meltwater slides off an iceberg, another puff of CO2 rises to the sky, another bubble of methane wafts up from the tundra.

Floods are surging. Wildfires are blazing. Heat and drought are desiccating the earth. People are suffering, their livelihoods combusting like so much dredged-up fossil matter.<br></p><p>And yet the best our politicians, pundits and CEOs can offer is the suicidal promise to keep beating the same business-as-usual drum that got us into this existential bind in the first place.<br></p><p>If we’re going to have any kind of future on this planet, we must go beyond reduced carbon footprints, net zero, renewables — all the wishful, technocratic thinking of our leaders — and start calling the shots from below. <br></p><p>Welcome to our surefire solution to the climate crisis. (Excerpted in nine parts from Adbusters’ upcoming book, <em>The Third Force: Field Guide to a New World Order.)</em></p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A Flaw in the Algorithm (PT. 1)</strong></h2><p><strong>‍</strong>If you burrow deep into the innards of the capitalist algorithm, you’ll find a major flaw: the vast majority of humankind’s carbon emissions are unpriced.<br></p><p>Out of the trillions of transactions made every day in the global marketplace, only a tiny fraction reflect their true cost. From the tires on our cars, to the phones in our hands, to the Big Macs nesting in our take-out bags, every purchase we make is essentially a mistake. And each one drives us a little closer to global system collapse.<br><br>With every bogus transaction, another drop of meltwater slides off an iceberg, another puff of CO2 rises to the sky, another bubble of methane burps from the tundra. If we keep repeating that mistake trillions of times a day, week after week, month after month, year after year, what do you think will happen?<br><br>Economists speak the language of efficiency. Why are so many economists silent on these, the greatest inefficiencies of all? We’re selling off our natural capital and calling it income. Why is the profession of economics, when it should be rushing to the breach to lead us, so monumentally negligent?<br><br>Economists, this is your new brief. Let’s figure this out. What is the real cost of shipping a container load of toys from Chongqing to Los Angeles? Or a case of apples grown in New Zealand to markets in North America? And what is the true cost of that fridge humming 24/7 in your kitchen? That steak sizzling on your grill? That car rolling off the production line?<br></p><p>How much are the byproducts of our way of living actually setting us back?</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>The Solution Emerges (PT. 2)</strong>‍</h2><p>The new accounting starts with the little stuff: plastic bags, coffee cups, paper napkins. <br></p><p>Let’s say the eco-costs turn out to be five cents per plastic bag, ten cents per cup and a fraction of a cent per paper napkin. We tack those on. Of course we’re already doing that with the various fees and taxes included in the price of tires, cans of paint and other products. But now we abandon the concept of ancillary fees and taxes and start implementing true-cost pricing across the board, from factory to doorstep.<br></p><p>This is the first step toward True Cost: a global marketplace in which the price of every product tells the ecological truth.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True-Cost Plastic (PT. 3)</strong>‍</h2><p>How much plastic is coming out of the industrial bunghole annually?<br></p><p>Economists, spin up a rough number. Say it’s a trillion tons. Then make your best guess at the environmental price we pay for our clogged garbage dumps, polluted oceans and the shitspray of plastic microbeads through the food chain. Say it’s $500 per ton. Every manufacturer, corporation and retailer that uses plastic in their business will be required to account for that.<br></p><p>Maybe it’s a surcharge of a quarter on every bottle of Coke. If Coca Cola can’t take a hit like that on their margin, they’ll have to change their business model. Likewise, the automobile industry will have to redesign their cars. Food producers will have to adapt.<br><br>The cost of living will rise, and that’ll hurt. But plastic packaging will gradually disappear from our lives. We’ll buy our milk in glass bottles and bring them in for recycling like we used to. We’ll wash our plates, knives and forks and use them year after year, some for a lifetime.<br></p><p>The garbage gyres in the oceans will shrink and finally disappear. Blight will vanish from beaches and ravines. Microplastics will stop plugging the tissues of every mammal, including us.<br></p><p>And the horror of bringing our children up in a world awash in plastic will be over.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True-Cost Driving (PT. 4)</strong>‍</h2><p>Once we account for the environmental cost of carbon emissions, the cost of building and maintaining roads, the medical costs of accidents, and the noise and the aesthetic degradation of urban sprawl, your personally owned car will cost you around $100,000, and a tank of gas $150. You’ll still be free to drive all you want, but instead of passing the costs on to future generations, you’ll pay up front.<br><br>Plenty of people will howl and moan — at least in the beginning. A bitter meme war will be fought about how true cost disproportionately punishes the poor.<br></p><p>But once true-cost pricing is in place, car use will plunge and bicycle use will soar. City skies will be clearer. Breathing easier. Ride sharing will spike. People will live closer to work. Demand for monorails, bullet trains, subways and streetcars will surge. A paradigm shift in urban planning will calm the pace of urban living. Cities will be built for people, not cars. Catastrophic weather events like hurricanes, floods and superfires will subside. The spectre of global warming won’t feel so ominous anymore.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True-Cost Eating (PT. 5)</strong>‍</h2><p>Once we tally the hidden costs of our industrial farming and food-processing systems, we raise the price of groceries to reflect the true cost of shipping them long distances. An avocado from Mexico will cost you $15. You won’t be able to indulge so often. And that shrimp from Indonesia? Once the eco devastation of mega-farming and container shipping are added on, it will run you about $35 a pound. A Whopper with cheese will quadruple in price. So will most meats, produce and processed foods.<br></p><p>You can still eat whatever you want, but you’ll have to pay the real tab. Inevitably, your palate will submit to your wallet. But the cost of organic and locally produced food will go down, nudging us all in that direction. Local farmers will be celebrated. We’ll grow tomatoes on our verandas, eat at home more and maybe lose some weight and be a little healthier. Bit by bit, purchase by purchase, our global food system will heave toward sustainability.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True-Cost Shipping (PT. 6)</strong>‍</h2><p>For years it’s been ridiculously cheap to use mega tankers to ship stuff across the ocean. That will stop.<br></p><p>Our current way of exporting and importing goods, the one economists have been touting as a way to spur growth but which depends on a mightily subsidized transportation system, will no longer fly. Globalization — capitalism’s bred-in-the-bone burden — will cease to be the dominant economic paradigm. Just about everything at the megamarts will cost more.<br></p><p>The whole tenor of world trade will be transformed. Exports and imports will stabilize at a reduced level. Trillions of purchases every day will come back to your neighborhood. A fairer, community-based marketplace will begin to emerge.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Next-Level Accounting (PT. 7)</strong></h2><p>For conventional economists, True Cost is a gut punch. A true-cost Marketplace would slow growth, reduce the flow of world trade and curb consumption. It would force economists to rethink just about every axiom they’ve taken for granted since the dawn of the industrial age.<br><br>The efficiency of size would be challenged. The hidden cost of Walmart coming to town, revealed. The lie of never-ending growth on a finite planet, exposed. &nbsp;<br><br>“Progress” itself would be redefined.<br><br>True Cost could turn out to be one of the most traumatic and painful social projects we have ever undertaken. But also one of the most transformative.<br><br>In a true-cost world, there’d be no need for pleading and hectoring, no need to wallow in conflicting consumer emotions. No one would be badgering you to eat less meat. No one would make you feel guilty about owning a car, or for going on that holiday to the Bahamas. All you’re being asked to do is become a consumer in a new kind of marketplace. &nbsp;<br><br>Instead of “lowest price wins, and don’t ask too many questions,” Adam Smith’s invisible hand would start working its magic in surprising new ways. We’d become part of a worldwide process in which every one of the trillions of transactions made every day are working <em>for</em> rather than <em>against</em> us.<br><br>Only a handful of economists have bothered to think of externalities as anything but marginalia — a few paragraphs in Gregory Mankiw’s textbook. True Cost would remake the entire profession.<br></p><p>It would put a shine on the dismal science. It would ground economists, give them something real to do. It would create a virtuous, progressive occupation out of a retrograde one. The profession would become something a young grad would be proud to devote their whole life to.<br></p><p>After all, it would be seen as the essential discipline for working our way out of this existential crisis. And a crucial pillar of a nascent true-cost political party.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True Cost in the Political Sphere (PT. 8)</strong></h2><p>We push to get True Cost on the platforms of all the green parties of the world. We unite them with a unified crisis-fighting vision.<br></p><p>Once they start winning elections, that’s when True Cost will begin to jell into a unified global force and branch off into its own world-spanning political movement.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Is True Cost a Pipedream? (PT. 9)</strong>‍</h2><p>“True Cost? Great idea! But it’s never gonna work.” That’s what they’ll all say.<br><br>I get it. Nothing of this scope, on this scale, has ever been tried. It feels like Plan D — a last-ditch effort to be deployed after all the more “sensible” green-energy and techno options have been kicked around.<br><br>And our record of working together is pretty dismal. Look how we handled Covid. We couldn’t come up with a coherent global thrust to beat it back. Or to distribute the vaccines. Hell, some of us couldn’t even agree to wear masks.<br><br>But the global mood will change as our planet overheats. Ecological collapse is a slow-motion catastrophe. But once we pass a tipping-point — when resource skirmishes erupt into full-scale wars, and slow violence turns into fast violence, and suddenly it’s your children who are hungry and your house that’s being swept away and your country that’s at war — that’s when you’ll forget “never gonna work” and reach for the ax on the wall.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Humanity’s Moment of Truth (PT. 10)</strong>‍</h2><p>The human race is now a Pachinko ball tumbling through the machine. There is simply no predicting the outcome.<br></p><p>It could well be that the best efforts of scientists and political leaders and activists will come to naught, and humanity will spiral into a new dark age that beggars the imagination.<br></p><p>But it’s equally possible that 11th-hour desperation will galvanize the people of earth into a state of readiness for an unprecedented, life-saving mass action.<br></p><p>A crack may well open in the human psyche. If so, True Cost is ready-made to fill it — an idea so huge, so revolutionary that it’ll tip the balance of world power and steer humanity inexorably toward a sane sustainable future.<br></p><p>This moment has never been more precious. The stakes have never been higher.</p>",,,<p>The Third Force</p>,"Storms are building. Floods are surging. Wildfires are blazing. Heat and drought are desiccating the earth.

We’re moving beyond any domestic political paradigm and starting to think and act as a global community.</p><p>We are the ass-kickers and care-givers and culture jammers. The ones who took the shit and waited on hold on our own dime. Who trekked up the mountain, ate the mushrooms, trod on the grass. Who dangled from the bridges, leafleted the neighborhoods, volleyed the tear-gas canisters back at the goons. Who bought a random kid a banana. Who cried their eyes out the night Charlie Parker died.</p><p>We are the artists, the poets, the philosophers and punks.</p><p>The homeless vets, the women who’ve been raped, the refugees floating on the ocean. The “deplorables” who come to mind when the poet says: <em>Everyone dies, but not everyone lives.</em></p><p>The Third Force is the most diverse, truly democratic voice the world has ever heard – really the only one that that speaks for everyone’s interests. We play a truer music, the way a huge choir of untrained singers is, collectively, perfectly in tune. It is the music of no one in particular but the planet in general.</p><p>We are the great yawp.</p><p>We are not a political party. Nobody voted for us. We don’t identify as Left <em>or</em> Right.</p><p>Like any real breakthrough has to be, we are a synthesis of opposites. From now on, politics will no longer be the usual slugfest between ideological shadow-selves. A third player with a radical new agenda has joined the fray.</p><p>Politics will look like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/602ef1697997d1436fd5083c_new_left_arrows_450x236.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Our elected governments, the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, etc. will continue to govern much as they always have. They will build the highways, collect the taxes, run the courts, deliver the mail. But now they will have to deal with this unsilenceable new voice demanding systemic transformations on multiple fronts.</p><p>When we the people feel our leaders are not paying attention, not handling things right, veering off course; when the gap between the rich and poor grows too wide; when corporations become too arrogant, Wall Street too greedy, secrecy too pervasive, surveillance too invasive and debt-collectors too fucking rude; when the norms, values and precepts that underlie our way of life are violated . . . that’s when we the people will come together as one and set things right.</p><p>Our power is in our numbers. Get enough people aligned — regular people with their sleeves rolled up and their feet swollen from standing all day — and their shouts become a kind of flocking signal. Like the spasm response of a kind of global immune system, triggered by a massive insult to the planet itself.</p><p>The Third Force is a new “evolutionary cluster,” a group that forms, when historical conditions are right, <em>because it has to</em>, to accelerate change and give humanity a chance. The difference this time is that the resurgents have a new tool, the first jungle telegraph that spans the whole world.</p><p>The internet has reversed a centuries-old power dynamic. Social media platforms are now a third arm of democracy, along with the law and government checks-and-balances. It’s not inconceivable that a couple of years from now, we can get millions of people to converge on hundreds of activist websites like abillionpeople.org. That’s enough to launch massive boycotts that bring wayward corporations to their knees. Enough to organize global big-bang moments when people swarm their cities demanding systemic change. We the people can now poke our noses into every policy debate, every election, every UN Security Council decision, every military conflict.</p><p>And we can penetrate deeper still, right into the beating heart of our global system, shifting paradigms, reversing money flows, triggering reformations, preventing wars.</p><p>The Third Force will burn its initials into the culture with this new tool — this holy fire you’re holding in the palm of your hand. </p><p>The Net is what we make of it. It can be a quagmire where you’re sucked in, submit to someone else’s agenda for awhile and come out feeling diminished. But we’ve also seen flashes of what the Net can do when it’s wielded as the sword of resistance. How quickly it can whip up a social transformation: The Arab Spring, #OccupyWallStreet, #MeToo, #BLM.</p><p>We’re just learning how to harness the power of the Net. Not in a surface way, reacting every few minutes to chaos, but slowly — learning to be <em>agents</em> now — burrowing down to first principles to prevent chaos from happening in the first place.</p><p>If we play this right, maintain clarity of mind, all the while keeping it loose, keeping it nimble, improvising riffs, being systems thinkers of the highest order, then we can become the dominant political force of the 21st century.</p><h4>The Revolution Algorithm</h4><p>Dana Meadows, the environmental scientist who co-authored <em>The Limits of Growth</em>, urged us to think below the surface. In her iceberg model of systems thinking, the events we see unfolding, the stuff that makes the news, are only a small part of life.</p><p>One level down lie trends.

We pull off a capitalist reformation — a painful but necessary move towards a new kind global marketplace in which the price of every product tells the ecological truth.</p><p><em>On the corporate front</em>, we launch the mother of all boycotts against one of the most criminal corporations in the world — ExxonMobil — and wipe it off the face of the earth. Once the mightiest has fallen, the rest will follow and a <em>Corporate Charter Revocation Movement</em> will be born.</p><p><em>On the financial front</em>, we force our leaders to eliminate all tax havens. We march worldwide for a 1% Robin Hood Tax on all stock market and currency transactions. We push for new rules to cool down insanely feverish bot-run trading. We propose an elegant idea: that you must hold a stock for 24 hours after its purchase before selling it.</p><p><em>On the economic front</em>, we set up subversive cells in the economics departments of universities around the world, and start disrupting classes, plastering posters and nailing <em>Kick It Over</em> manifestoes on professor’s doors. We expose the current science of economics as a hindering profession, disastrously out of tune. We pull off a revolutionary leap in economic thinking — a paradigm shift toward a new model that works in the real world.</p><p><em>On the political front</em>, We make secrecy taboo in all but the most sensitive areas of national security. We clamp down on the arms trade. In nation after nation, we pass constitutional amendments requiring referendums in which no war can start without the assent of the majority of the people.</p><p><em>On the aesthetic front</em>, we transform the ambient tone of the world.

The Berlin Wall was about to fall. Solidarity was in the air, and the environmental movement was driving it. We’d seen the whole Earth from space and by God it looked vulnerable, hanging out there in the darkness. Like: Holy hell we barely register in the cosmic accounting. Environmentalism wasn’t some kind of consensus we all arrived at: it was an existential reaction that prompted a million gut-level responses — from Greenpeace activists racing toward Alaska on the (doomed) <em>Rainbow Warrior</em>, to hippies huddling up in communes on the city fringes. It was a moment of sacred reckoning. The Earth was<em> alive</em>. She was Gaia: the rivers her veins, the forests her hair, the oceans her lungs. And we humans an organic part of her. It felt like we were embarking on a spiritual journey that would take all of humanity to a new level of consciousness.</p><p>Sure, there was a lot of damage: poisoned rivers, vanishing forests, acid rain. Corporations behaving badly. Network television hijacking our attention with a barrage of pro-consumption messages every hour. But it was nothing we couldn’t fix.</p><p>Then something unexpected happened.</p><p>We <em>kind</em> of knew about global warming, but it was buried on our list of concerns, somewhere below pollution and the ozone hole. Now, suddenly, it was the whole show.</p><p>What we had on our hands, it became clear, was a terrestrial-suffocation event. The oceans slowly starved of oxygen – an <em>I can’t breathe</em> dirge for the planet itself. The Great Barrier Reef dying slowly and then quickly. Methane bubbling up from arctic permafrost. Whole species winking out at mind-blowing rates. The whole ecological structure that evolution had built up over billions of years was crashing down upon us.</p><p>This wasn’t a cleanup job any more. It was about survival.</p><p>Throughout our history, through wars, genocides, pandemics and long dark ages, we humans have always bounced back. Our story has always kept moving along. But all our previous escapes meant nothing now. This could genuinely be the end. Our 10,000-year-old civilizational experiment was now riding on one last throw.</p><p>The environmental movement mobilized. They tossed every idea they had onto the table.</p><p>You double down on carbon sequestration. You grow wheat as a perennial, not an annual crop — and use biotech to increase the yield. You start massive kelp farms, harness streams in run-of-river hydroelectric projects, capture tidal energy at headland pinch points. You build wind farms and solar arrays all over the world. You transition to electric cars. You dangle weights heavier than the Eiffel Tower over abandoned mine shafts as gravity batteries, backup power to the grid. You champion localized capitalism and Modern Monetary Theory. You pull the trigger on geo-engineering: cloud-seeding, mirrors in space. And we all bite the bullet and decide to live more lightly on the planet. A new fair, just, sustainable and secure global system will emerge if we all just pitch in.</p><p>Right?</p><p>To me that’s exactly what’s <em>not</em> going to work.</p><p>These interventions aren’t nothing — of course we should pursue a lot of them. But let’s face it: fifty years of environmental activism has added up to little more than a rounding error on the climate emergency. “Cap and Trade” has been a bust. Carbon credits are the papal indulgences of the 21st century.</p><p>We can’t simply continue the strategy of playing the same game differently. We’ll never get to net-zero that way.</p><p>The late Stanford philosopher and therapist Paul Watzlawick had a good way of explaining how to get out of impossible jams. When change is required, there are different ways to think about the level of creativity that’s needed.</p><p>A “first-order” change is to stamp on the gas pedal. A second-order change is to shift gears.

From the tires on our cars to the phones in our hands, right down to the napkins that McDonald’s hands out with their Big Mac &amp; fries . . . <em>every purchase we make is essentially a mistake</em>. And each one drives us a little closer to global system collapse.</p><p>With every bogus transaction, another drop of meltwater slides off an iceberg, another puff of CO2 rises to the sky, another bubble of methane wafts up from the tundra. If we keep repeating that mistake, trillions of times a day, week after week, month after month, year after year, what do you think will happen?</p><p>To date, only a handful of economists have bothered to think about the true cost of what we buy and do. They speak the language of efficiency, and have taught the whole world to do the same. Why are so many of our leading economists silent, then, on these, the greatest inefficiencies of all? Why are we selling off our natural capital and calling it income? Why is the profession of economics committing such a monumental system error?</p><p>Let’s figure this out. What is the real cost of shipping a container load of toys from Chongqing to Los Angeles? Or a case of apples grown in New Zealand to markets in North America? And what is the true cost of that fridge humming 24/7 in your kitchen . . . that steak sizzling on your grill . . . that car sitting in your garage? What are the byproducts of our way of living actually costing us? Grab a calculator and let’s get at this. Instead of watching economists pontificate endlessly about interest rates, stock-market swings and GDP growth, let’s put them to productive big-picture use crunching the real cost of things.</p><p>‍</p><h2>The Road To True Cost</h2><p>We start with the little things: plastic bags, coffee cups, paper napkins. Economists sleuth out the eco-costs — say it’s five cents per plastic bag, ten cents per cup and a fraction of a cent per paper napkin — and those we tack on. We’re already doing that with the various eco-fees and eco-taxes included in the price of tires, cans of paint and other products. But now we abandon the concept of ancillary fees and taxes and start implementing true-cost pricing right across the board.</p><p>‍</p><h2>True-Cost Plastic</h2><p>How much plastic is coming out of the industrial bunghole annually? Economists spitball a number. Say it’s a trillion tons. Then they come up with their best estimate of the environmental price we pay for our clogged garbage dumps, polluted oceans and the shitspray of plastic microbeads through the food chain – say it’s $500 per ton. Every manufacturer, corporation and retailer that uses plastic in their business will be required to account for that. Maybe it’s a surcharge of a quarter on every bottle of Coke. Coca Cola can’t take a hit like that on their margin. They’ll have to change their business model. Likewise, the automobile industry will have to redesign their cars. Food producers will have to adapt.</p><p>The cost of living will go up, and that’ll hurt. But plastic packaging will gradually disappear from our lives. We’ll buy our milk in glass bottles and bring them in for recycling like we used to. We’ll wash our plates, knives and forks and use them year after year, some for a lifetime. The garbage gyres in the oceans will shrink and finally disappear. Blight will vanish from beaches and ravines. Microplastics will stop plugging the tissues of every mammal including us. And the horror of bringing our children up in a world awash in plastic will be over.</p><p>‍</p><h2>True-Cost Driving</h2><p>Once we add on the environmental cost of carbon emissions, the cost of building and maintaining roads, the medical costs of accidents, the noise and the aesthetic degradation of urban sprawl, your private automobile will cost you around $100,000, and a tank of gas $150. You’ll still be free to drive all you want, but instead of passing the costs on to future generations, you’ll pay up front.</p><p>Plenty of people will call bullshit on the concept – at least in the beginning. But once it’s in place, we’ll see a fundamental transformation in how we get around. Car use will plunge and bicycle use soar. Ride sharing will spike. People will live closer to work. Demand for monorails, bullet trains, subways and streetcars will surge. A paradigm shift in urban planning will calm the pace of urban living. Cities will be built for people, not cars. City skies will be clearer. Breathing easier. Catastrophic weather events like hurricanes, floods and superfires will subside. The spectre of global heating won’t feel so ominous anymore.</p><p>‍</p><h2>True-Cost Eating</h2><p>We estimate and add in the hidden costs of our industrial farming and food processing systems. We raise the price of groceries to reflect the true cost of shipping them long distances. An avocado from Mexico will cost you $15. You won’t be able to indulge so often. And that shrimp from Indonesia? Once the eco-devastation of mega farming and container shipping are added on, it will run you about $35 a pound. A Big Mac will cost quite a bit more. So will most meats, produce and processed foods. You can still eat whatever you want, but you’ll have to pay the real price. Inevitably, your palate will submit to your wallet. It will be tough, especially on lower income families. But the cost of organic and locally produced food will go down and provide a good alternative. Local farmers will be celebrated. We will grow tomatoes on our verandas, eat at home more and maybe lose some weight and be a little healthier. Bit by bit, purchase by purchase, lifestyle change by lifestyle change, our global food system will heave toward sustainability.</p><p>‍</p><h2>True-Cost Shipping</h2><p>For years it’s been ridiculously cheap to use mega tankers to ship container loads of stuff across the ocean. Much of that will stop. Our current way of exporting and importing goods, the one economists have been touting as a way to spur growth, but which depends on a mightily subsidized transportation system, will no longer fly. Globalization — capitalism’s bred-in-the-bone burden — will cease to be the dominant economic paradigm. Just about everything at the multinational megamarts will cost more. The whole tenor of world trade will be transformed. Exports and imports will stabilize at a reduced level. Trillions of purchases every day will come back to your neighborhood.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Next-level Accounting: The Social and Psychic Costs</h2><p>You’re cruising along an eight-lane highway and suddenly everything lurches to a halt. There’s a lot more going on here than a hefty blast of carbon emissions. A traffic jam is a huge collective stress event. There are health costs to being pinned in your car, on a dammed river of steel, fingers tightening on the wheel, blood pressure rising. Mental health costs too. A recent Swedish study found that a daily commute of forty-five minutes or longer increases your chance of divorce by 40 percent.</p><p>What is the psychic cost of advertising, that daily broadside of proconsumption messages? Or the mental toll of continually checking your phone — basically tugging on the leg-hold trap of Big Tech’s surveillance algorithms, over and over and over? Or the social and psychological cost of losing the indie shops in your neighborhood as Starbucks, Home Depot and Walmart muscle their way in. All this is part of the True Cost story — and so must eventually be part of the final accounting — of the epidemic of mental illness now sweeping the planet.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/607e013432d3051632d2af79_consumerism_graph_growth_422x312.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>For conventional economists, True Cost is a frightening, heretical concept. A True-Cost marketplace would slow growth, reduce the flow of world trade and curb consumption. It would force economists to rethink just about every axiom they’ve taken for granted since the dawn of the industrial age.</p><p>The efficiency of size would be challenged. The hidden cost of Walmart coming to town, revealed.</p><p>The logic of never-ending growth on a finite planet would be thrown back in economists’ faces.</p><p>“Progress” itself would be redefined.</p><p>There will even be angels-on-a-pin debates about the psychological and social costs of individualism.</p><p>True Cost could turn out to be one of the most traumatic and painful economic / social / cultural projects we have ever undertaken.</p><p>But it would also be strangely transformative.</p><p>In a True-Cost world, there’d be no need for pleading and hectoring, no need to wallow in conflicting consumerist emotions. No one would be badgering you to eat less meat. No one would make you feel guilty about owning a car, or for going on that holiday to the Bahamas. None of that. All you’re being asked to do is become a consumer in a new kind of marketplace.</p><p>Instead of “lowest price wins, and don’t ask too many questions,” Adam Smith’s invisible hand would start working its magic in surprising new ways. We’d become part of a worldwide process in which every one of the trillions of transactions made every day are working for rather than against us.</p><p>In the current language of economics, the costs you don’t see, the ones that don’t show up in the models, are dismissed as “externalities” — just the trims and ends left over when you run the growth numbers. Only a handful of economists have bothered to think of these costs as anything other than marginalia — a few paragraphs in Gregory Mankiw’s <em>Principles of Economics</em> textbook.</p><p>True Cost will put a shine on ‘the dismal science.’ Economists would suddenly have a fresh mandate: to work out and fold in all the costs of our way of doing business. This would ground them, give them something real to do. It would create a virtuous, progressive occupation out of a retrograde one. The profession would become a highly desirable place to be — something a young grad would be proud to devote their whole life to. Environmentally minded students would be streaming into Econ 101 because now economics is the <em>Queen of the Sciences</em>, incorporating sociology, anthropology and psychology. It would be the essential discipline for working our way out of the existential crisis we’re in.</p><p>‍</p><h2>The Savior Mechanism</h2><p>Implementing a True-Cost global marketplace would actually be quite simple. It could be made to work through the UPC code that’s already on just about every product sold around the world. When you swipe it, a True-Cost price adjustment automatically kicks in. All the ecological costs of making and marketing and shipping and distributing that thing you’re buying are baked in to the price. One swipe, one truth. Sticker shock: take it or leave it.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/607e03ec3409bd0ed647b412_barcode_stickmen_395x272.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>True Cost will generate a vast amount of money — probably in the trillions of dollars a year. Agreeing on how to spend it will no doubt be a messy, angry, contentious affair. It may well torpedo the whole project. But it could also turn into a beautiful collective brainstorm. Humanity’s joint endeavor. The birth of a global mind, with the stakes as high as they go: our very survival.</p><p>The True-Cost bounty would amount to a kind of global superfund. Money would flow to each nation, based on its population, to spend as it sees fit.</p><p>Many countries might choose to plow it into priority projects to help them reach their carbon-reduction goals. Others might decide to bounce some, or even all of it, directly back to the taxpayers. A hefty check would arrive periodically in the mail, as compensation. People agree to take the pain up front, knowing relief will come.</p><p>The nations of the world may agree to pool some of the money into a global-emergency relief fund, to be spent by the United Nations and NGOs when calamities occur. For the always cash-strapped UN and relief organizations, and for people anywhere in the world who suddenly cannot cope, that would be a godsend.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Is True Cost a Pipedream?</h2><p>True Cost? Great idea! But it’s never gonna work.</p><p>That’s what they all say.</p><p>I get it. Nothing of this scope, on this scale, has ever been tried. It feels like Plan D — after all the more ‘sensible,’ green-energy and techno options have been kicked around.</p><p>And our record of working together is pretty dismal. Look at how we handled Covid. We couldn’t come up with a coherent global thrust to beat it back. Or to distribute the vaccines. Hell, some of us couldn’t even agree to wear masks.</p><p>But the global mood will change as our planet overheats. Ecological collapse is a slow-motion catastrophe. You don’t <em>feel</em> it yet, You can’t apprehend the urgency of it. Because your hair isn’t on fire. Yet.</p><p>But once we pass a tipping-point — and we’ll absolutely know it when it happens — when resource skirmishes erupt into full-scale wars, and slow violence turns into fast violence, and suddenly it’s <em>your</em> children who are hungry and <em>your</em> house that’s being swept away and <em>your</em> country that’s at war . . . that’s when you’ll forget “never gonna work” and reach for the ax on the wall.</p><p>‍</p>",,,,"The world was in a phase change.

We love our dish washers, spin dryers and microwave ovens. We love our throw away diapers, pre-washed veggies and ready-to-eat dinners delivered right to our door. And we love cruising in our cars with our favorite music playing. The idea of living more austere lives is anathema. We’re hooked on all of this stuff now. Whatever it takes, we gotta have our Doritos.</p><p>That’s just the way it is.</p><p>Or is it?</p><p>Look at it this way: If we’re pliable enough to have allowed ourselves to be moulded into ferocious consuming machines, to have our minds be re-wired like that, then we’re pliable enough to self-correct in the other direction. A lifestyle is really nothing less than a collection of habits. And habits can absolutely be overridden.</p><p>Convincing people that an experiment like this is even worth a try, that will be the biggest hurdle. We’re talking about curbing the personal freedoms we’ve taken for granted for centuries. “Dammit, my right to indulge myself is constitutionally protected!” Americans will say. Anything less is heresy. We can’t do this. We won’t do it. Go to hell!</p><p>Except we <em>have</em> done it. Recently.</p><p>We did it during Covid.</p><p>For a year and a half we were forced to social distance – something that seemed alien to our genetic makeup. If we can learn to live like <em>that</em> — a hockey stick away from one another at all times — surely we can learn to curb other private pleasures for the sake of our collective survival. And do that <em>until it becomes a reflex</em>. Just as a tiny alarm went off in your head when you came too close to a stranger, a tiny alarm will go off if you’re taking more than your pound of flesh from the Earth. You start reaching for the hamburger and some flash of conscience says:<em> Nope. Not going there today</em>. You’re about to hop in your car to drive to work but you stop in the driveway. Today I won’t. It’s not raining, I’ll take my bike. And tonight, while throwing your clothes into the dryer, you have another of those double-clutch moments. You recall just how much energy an appliance with a heat element uses. There’s already a heat element in the sky, and it’s free. This weekend you’ll set up a system for drying your clothes in the sun.</p><p>Dozens of little strategic “social saving” behaviors like this will slide into place, until the friction goes out of each one of them. Now they’re simply part of how you live and who you are. Now it’s just your own conscience plus what-the-fuck-else-have-we-got? Those two together are a powerful pincer. Powerful enough, maybe, to make hundreds of millions of us take the personal plunge and vow to live True-Cost lives.</p><p>For a few of us, True Cost will amount to a lifestyle tweak — a little extra attentiveness to consumption patterns already mostly under control. But for many let-’er-rip first-world consumers it’ll be a <em>revolutionary</em> change. Or what the University of New Mexico psychologist William Miller calls a “quantum change.” That is, a radical course correction some people make after a kind of sudden apprehension of where they fit in the big human story.</p><p>True Cost shouldn’t feel like a punishment. It should be deeply satisfying to know that our purchases are helping to correct inequities and distortions. Helping to lift someone out of poverty on the other side of the world. Helping to save many living things – trees, cows, rhinos — because they’re now worth more alive than dead. It should give us joy that we are somehow balancing the books.</p><p>That’s why there might actually not be the almighty pushback you’d expect — even from ardent anti-socialists — to the True-Cost shift in human consciousness that has to happen.</p><p>‍</p><h2>A New Myth</h2><p>The man who proposed the Gaia hypothesis, James Lovelock, is hopeful at age 100 that what’s going to save Gaia is the very species that drove her to the brink: us. Or rather, a technologically enhanced us. Cyborgs, programmed to save themselves, will save Earth, he reckons. </p><p>I have my doubts. I think it’s going to take something way more personal and emotional. Because until you can feel what needs to be done, you won’t do it. If it seems like a hellacious sacrifice to do what needs doing, we won’t do it. It has to instead take the form of — let’s just say it — a <em>spiritual</em> leap.</p><p>I think it’s time to write a new chapter in the human story, one that circles back to the original mythologies many indigenous people never lost.</p><p>These myths are not Great-Man stories. They don’t put us humans at the center of the spinning world. They’re about systems, networks, generational heaves. In these cultures, Gaia was never a “hypothesis” that dropped intellectually into the zeitgeist and then gradually lost heat. It’s a truth that always was.</p><p>In Bolivia the goddess Pachamama (literally “cosmic mother”) hovers over the land. Everyone from the indigenous people to practicing Catholics are swept into her unifying ethic of gratitude and grace. Scientists don’t try to re-educate this “magical” belief out of folks. The religiously faithful don’t dismiss Pachamama for failing to speak for their particular denomination. Individual belief systems come and go like the clouds over the Andes. But values like kindness, solidarity and humility, these are permanent. And universal. And maybe the only way out.</p><p>Lately, Masako and I have been getting into the serial “Kirin ga Kuru” on Saturday afternoon television. It’s about a Samurai warrior in 16thcentury Japan. A century of warring tribes has plunged the world into chaos. Blood runs in the valleys. The kirin is a mythic creature that shows up when a culture is in transition. <em>Kirin ga Kuru</em> means “waiting for the kirin.” If the kirin comes, it means the carnage is over and peace has descended upon the land.</p><p>In real-life Japan, this actually happened. The warring tribes stopped warring. The kirin came.</p><p>Japan’s war with itself resolved only after the country found itself facing a bigger menace, from outside, when the “black ships” arrived with guns more powerful than swords. Only then did the country pull together.</p><p>That’s what has to happen now on a global scale.</p><p>There’s a theory that humans simply cannot co-exist peacefully. We’re just too bellicose and self-absorbed. We’ll fight and raid each other’s resources till there’s nothing left but smoking ash. Only one thing can change that pattern: if all the nations of Earth suddenly find themselves aligned against a common threat. Like an alien invasion.</p><p>The climate emergency is our alien invasion. It’s an existential threat to every earthling all at once. Only a giant recalibration now can save us — an audacious plan that everyone has the stones to commit to and implement together.</p><p>We pull off a major reshuffling of priorities within the science of economics. We overhaul our economic system. We put something like a True-Cost marketplace in place. We endure the pain of price hikes and disciplined living, because the only thing worse than this pain is the pain of not doing it.</p><p>We tweak as needed. We stay the course.</p><p>That’s what the Third Force is all about.

It’s a story of fierce individualism and heroic personal sacrifice in the service of a dream. A story of hungry settlers carving a home out of the wilderness. A story of a revolution, beating back British imperialism and launching a new colony into the industrial age on its own terms.<br></p><p>It’s a story of America triumphant. Of its rise after World War II to become the richest and most powerful country in the history of the world, the land of the free because of the brave, an inspiring model for the whole world to emulate.<br></p><p>The <em>unofficial</em> story of America is quite different. It begins the same way — in the revolutionary cauldron of colonial America — but then it takes a turn. A bit player in the official story becomes critically important. This player turns out to be not only the provocateur of the revolution, but in a sense its saboteur.<br></p><p><em>The corporation.</em><br></p><p>We tend to think of corporations as a fairly recent phenomenon, the legacy of the 19th-century robber barons. But they were front-and-center in pre-revolutionary America. They had a beachhead before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock; the language of their charters is in the DNA of the Constitution. The Virginia Company of London, the Massachusetts Bay Company, the British East India Company: these were the Amazon and Wal-Mart and Google of their day.<br></p><p>But back then our dealings with these behemoths was very different. The colonials were highly suspicious of them. They recognized the way British kings and their cronies used them as robotic arms to control the affairs of the colonies, to plunder resources and bring them back to the motherland.<br></p><p>The colonials pushed back. When the British East India company slapped duties on its incoming tea (and they had the colonials over a barrel; that’s how monopolies work), well, you know that story. Radical patriots protested, ships were turned back at port and 342 chests of tea ended up in the saltchuck.<br></p><p>The Boston Tea Party gave young America a glimpse of its own strength. Self-determination was starting to seem not just possible but inevitable.<br></p><p>The Declaration of Independence freed America not just from British rule but also from the tyranny of British corporations, and for a hundred years Americans remained deeply wary of corporate power. Corporate charters weren’t the formality they are today; they were granted very selectively and for a specific purpose — usually to raise money to fund some common-good project. (You literally could not get a corporate charter unless you could prove there was a service dimension to the venture.) They put limits on how big and powerful the corporation could become. And they had a self-destruct mechanism: they automatically dissolved when their purpose was fulfilled.<br></p><p>Even the enormous industry trusts proved no match for the state in those early years. Antitrust legislation kept their appetites in check.<br></p><p>Corporations couldn’t participate in the political process. They couldn’t buy stock in other corporations. If they stepped out of line, the punishment could be severe. Charters could be revoked, and some were. In 1832, the state of Pennsylvania found ten banks to be acting against the public interest and wiped them off the face of the earth.<br></p><p>The people — not the corporations — were in control.<br></p><p>So what happened? How did corporations come to wield more power than the individuals who created them?<br></p><p>The shift began in the last third of the nineteenth century — the start of a great period of struggle between corporations and civil society. The turning point was the Civil War. Corporations made huge profits from procurement contracts. They took advantage of the disorder and corruption of the times to buy legislatures, judges and even presidents. President Lincoln foresaw terrible trouble. “Corporations have been enthroned,” he warned, shortly before his death. “An era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power will endeavor to prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the people … until wealth is aggregated in a few hands … and the republic is destroyed.”<br></p><p>Nobody listened. Corporations continued to roll. They had the laws governing their creation amended. Charters could no longer be revoked. Corporate profits could no longer be limited. In hundreds of cases judges granted corporations minor legal victories, conceding new rights and privileges.<br></p><p>Then came a legal event that would not be understood for decades (and remains baffling even today), an event that would change the course of American history. In <em>Santa Clara County vs Southern Pacific Railway</em>, a dispute over a railway route, the U.S. Supreme Court deemed that a private corporation was a “natural person” under the U.S. Constitution and therefore entitled to protection under the Bill of Rights. Suddenly, corporations enjoyed all the rights and sovereignty previously enjoyed only by people.<br></p><p>Santa Clara was nothing less than a corporate takeover. It’s still widely considered one of the great legal blunders of the nineteenth century. Corporations employed 80 percent of the workforce and produced most of America’s wealth by the the Roaring Twenties. They had become too powerful to legally challenge. The courts consistently favored their interests. Employees found themselves without recourse if, for example, they were injured on the job (if you worked for a corporation you voluntarily assumed the risk, was the court’s position). Railroad and mining companies were permitted to annex vast tracts of land at minimal expense.<br></p><p>Gradually, many of the original ideals of the American Revolution were simply quashed. America was being ruled by a coalition of government and business interests. The shift amounted to a kind of slow-motion coup d’état — a gradual subversion and takeover of the institutions of state power. Except for a temporary setback during Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal (the 1930s), the U.S. has since been governed as a corporate state.<br></p><p>Today, corporations freely buy each other’s stocks and shares. They lobby legislators and bankroll elections. They manage the flow of information, set our industrial, economic and cultural agendas, and grow as big as they damn well please.<br></p><p>We the people have lost control. Corporations, these legal fictions we ourselves created two centuries ago, now rule over us. And we accept this as the normal state of affairs.

My daughter engaged with him then. She used her Gen Z <em id="""">bona fides</em> to get the straight dope.</p><p id="""">“I think my dad’s getting his wallet,” she said. “But I’m just curious: How many Nos would it have taken for you to leave?”</p><p id="""">He leaned in and lowered his voice. “One more,” he said. “At the fourth no, no means no.”</p><p id="""">His secret was out. The company script was clear on this. The fourth refusal would have set me free.</p><p id="""">There was, I now believe, a universal lesson in this small dumb exchange that may be key to stopping the shitshow breaking across the world.</p><h3 id="""">“THE EXPERIMENT REQUIRES THAT YOU CONTINUE.”</h3><p id="""">In Stanley Milgram’s famous “obedience to authority” studies – the ones where test subjects thought they were administering powerful shocks to a volunteer in the next room for their goofs on a memory test – the subjects grew increasingly uncomfortable with inflicting pain on this poor stranger. And yet their misgivings were dismissed. When they balked, the experimenter pressed them to continue.</p><p id="""">After the first refusal the subjects heard: “Please continue.”</p><p id="""">Second refusal: “The experiment requires that you continue.”</p><p id="""">Third refusal: “It is absolutely essential that you continue.”</p><p id="""">The fourth refusal shut down the experiment. But most subjects didn’t have the stones to say No a fourth time. Sixty-five percent went all the way to the maximum charge of a life-threatening 450 volts. Even Milgram – who hatched the experiment in the wake of WWII to explore compliance to Nazi atrocities among “regular Germans” never expected numbers like that.</p><p id="""">Defiance. What does that word mean to you? The dictionary says: “to challenge the power of somebody else boldly and openly.” Not the trait of a team player. Makes you a loose cannon – and who wants to be that? And so we live in a compliance culture. We don’t defy authority because it mostly doesn’t even occur to us to.</p><p id="""">People are basically timid sheep in the face of authority, says the Cornell organizational psychologist Sunita Sah, an expert on defiance. We kowtow even when not doing that could save lives. (Nine out of ten healthcare workers, most of them nurses, didn’t feel comfortable speaking up when they saw a superior making an error.) We zip a lip around the people in charge, not just when they’re fucking up, but even when they’re doing things that bulldoze our principles.</p><p id="""">The old definition is bullshit, by Sah’s lights. Defiance is not a vice but a virtue. “To defy is simply to act in accordance with your values when there’s pressure to do otherwise.” It’s more than a virtue: defiance is “the obligation of every citizen when confronted with wrongdoing.”</p><p id="""">If ever in our lifetimes there were wrongdoing that required mass defiance, it’s now. Now, in the face of escalating authoritarian creep (by an authoritarian creep!) that at this point can only be called a coup.</p><p id="""">Blind obedience is not a habit of grown-ups. It’s something everyone in a functioning democracy must mature out of. In a family, obedience is the law ... but eventually we come to learn it’s the highest calling to become an adult. In a culture, obedience is the law ... but eventually we come to understand it isn’t the highest calling to become an effective citizen. There comes a time to say, Hell no, bro.</p><p id="""">But it takes courage! Because obedience to authority is the safest path to security. Crushing social pressure to conform means we stifle the little voice of conscience inside us.</p><p id="""">Indeed, so effective is the gaslighting in an authoritarian regime that we may talk ourselves out of acknowledging that there’s anything to be defiant <em id="""">about</em>, even as the contours of control morph under our noses: now they’ve taken the C-suites; now they’ve taken the courts; now they’ve taken the media. Eventually if dawns on you that, my god, they’re trying to overturn democracy itself. But by now it may be too late. Your refusals haven’t registered as refusals at all. Because you haven’t done anything.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">YOUR LADDER OF DEFIANCE</strong></h3><p id="""">The psychological machinery of defiance grinds quietly away in every skull, according to Sah, in a sequence that goes something like this:</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stage one:</strong> tension arises from this uncomfortable ask.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stage two:</strong> acknowledging the tension. Big red flag here. You don’t feel right about this at all.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stage three:</strong> expressing your misgivings out loud.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stage four:</strong> repeating your growing urge to say no.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stage five:</strong> actually refusing.</p><p id="""">Stage one and two are the business of the body. Your body can’t really be gaslit. It knows when big pieces are being moved under cover of darkness. That’s what it’s trying to tell you with the rising sense of dread.</p><p id="""">It’s at stage three that the crucial turn happens. Once you’ve communicated your alarm to another person, you’re much more likely to follow through and actually ... defy.</p><p id="""">But it’s also the moment where the stakes jump mightily.</p><p id="""">After Pearl Harbor, the Americans of Japanese descent cattled in internment camps on the West Coast were given a mandatory “loyalty questionnaire” to fill out. Questions 27 and 28 were the main ones of interest to the Americans:</p><p id="""">Question 27: “Will you serve in the military on combat duty wherever ordered?”</p><p id="""">Question 28: “Do you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America?”</p><p id="""">At this point most of the internees caved and said yes – it seemed the only out from much more misery. But some said no. They’d been defiant all along and they weren’t about to change their mind now. The final refusal was the one they put in writing.<sup href=""https://adbusters.substack.com/p/a08acfb5-e48d-4e09-9b80-4137159c729f?postPreview=paid&updated=2025-05-15T19%3A40%3A10.938Z&audience=everyone&free_preview=false&freemail=true#footnote-1-163581810"" target=""_self"" id="""">1</sup></p><p id="""">That public declaration is the hammer. You’re in deep shit now. But also, for the first time, you are free, for you have let your true self speak.</p><p id="""">For their impertinence, this pack of disloyal Japanese Americans – dubbed “The No-No boys” – was shipped to the much more dire Tule Lake, a concentration camp in Northern California, where they remained, defiant to the end, for four more years (until Roosevelt was publicly shamed into releasing them). It’s fair to say the No-No boys were less in “detention” than some other of the men. What’s so liberating about actually defying, says Sah, is that “the tension you’re feeling just evaporates. It feels great to bring your values and your actions back into alignment. It leaves you to have a more honest life.”</p><p id=""""><br>By the time you reach your fourth and final No – the topmost rung on your ladder of defiance – another emotion is in play. It’s urgency. Okay, panic. Of the kind that seizes folks in the final stage of that nightmarish “First they came for the Communists...” scenario. One by one the vulnerable groups have quietly been cleared out, because nobody spoke up for them. And now there’s a knock at <em id="""">your</em> door.</p><p id="""">Panic is the most primal fuel of all. You’re going, <em id="""">Fuck I have to stop this</em>. It’s not even just about you at this point – it’s about your grandchildren’s future.</p><p id="""">The fourth refusal happens when your red line is crossed.</p><p id="""">So this is the question we all need to ask ourselves right now:</p><p id="""">Where is <em id="""">my</em> red line?</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">REFUSAL IS A TRAINABLE SKILL</strong></h3><p id="""">The fourth refusal is the source code of democracy. Each one of us needs the bravery to carry on refusing till we reach it.</p><p id="""">Refusal is a trainable skill.</p><p id="""">Defiance is a skill set. Practicing it changes your brain. And has a ripple effect on others who observe it. So says Sah.</p><p id="""">There are three questions to ask yourself when compliance is demanded but you know in your heart you should defy:</p><p id="""">1) Who am I?</p><p id="""">2) Is it safe to defy here?</p><p id="""">3) What does a person like me do in a situation like this?</p><p id="""">Sociologist James Marsh calls this The Defiance Compass.</p><p id="""">Sometimes refusal is self-serving. There are stories of rookie cops who refused to comply with orders because they thought it was too dangerous (going into this house without notice and without a warrant ... nope, too many unknowns.) Sometimes refusal is just your survival instincts kicking in.</p><p id="""">That’s what we need to tap now across the whole culture. Defying <em id="""">en masse</em> is an existential move.</p><p id="""">As the fascist narrative bubbles up again, we must refuse. We must all become one of those minority of Milgram’s subjects who defied the experimenter. We must all become one of the No-No Boys.</p><p id="""">“To confront the Trump government without compromise, we must raise what MLK called a ‘coalition of conscience,’ writes Timothy Seseki Kudo – whose father was one of those No-No Boys, and is furious to see the same injustices repeated in the mass deportations of US-born citizens currently underway. His own very public refusal is a call-to-arms: “Elected leaders must oppose the assault on constitutional rights they’ve sworn to uphold and defend. Mayors and governors of sanctuary cities must unite in opposition, file legal challenges and refuse to allow local law enforcement, administrative and logistical resources from being used to carry out this immoral policy. And we must fight state by state in every single election for every single office until we have turned back the tide of cruelty sweeping across America.”</p><p id="""">Here’s the thing: Fascists depend on convincing us that there’s no point fighting cuz we’ve already lost. That’s how minority regimes cling to power – by getting the majority to think there’s nothing they can do.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Don’t believe it!</strong></p><p id="""">The moment demands the mass recruitment of what the Catholic theologian Matthew Fox calls “spiritual warriors.” “Every citizen who gives a damn about honesty and caring in our government and democracy should be on deck contributing what they can to resist and oppose the dismantling of our government.”</p><p id="""">“We have the people!” says the <em id="""">Guardian</em> labor journalist Hamilton Nolan. “The numbers are on our side. Trump and Elon Musk are like two guys with six-shooters trying to hold a thousand people hostage. They only win if everyone thinks they are too strong to rush.”</p><p id="""">Resist. Resist like you are defending a piece of land. This is the imperative of all of us now. We must all hang in there with our refusals – one, two, three, four – until No means No. Nothing less will do in the face of the deadly geopolitical game we’re walking into, with its dueling autocracies. This thing will roll over us. It will roll over us unless we stand as one. Come what may.</p><p id="""">If only a few people choose to walk into the line of fire, they’re dead. If <em id="""">everyone</em> does, they are, as a group, unstoppable. You may not personally take a bullet.

There's a Peculiar Strangeness to Being Canadian in America,theres-a-peculiar-strangeness-to-being-canadian-in-america,65c28f6b17c6d6d0d042a41c,65c28f6b17c6d6d0d042b20f,false,false,Fri Mar 31 2023 17:23:40 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Sep 12 2023 17:24:22 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Nov 05 2024 00:01:07 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),false,"<p id="""">It is a long way from the west coast of Canada to central New Jersey. In August, I moved from the Lower Mainland to Middlesex County, some 35 miles southwest of New York City, and found out just how vast the width of the continent can feel. I traded not just the Pacific for the Atlantic but the city for the suburbs, mountains for flatlands, wilderness for concrete, green for grey. I gave up forests of cedar and spruce and gained (far fewer) oaks and sycamores. I swapped dollars for dollars, the only currency that counts. I left behind the rains only to find myself parched. I was no longer in the land where I was born. I had become an alien. </p><p id="""">There is a peculiar strangeness to being Canadian in the United States. Everything is familiar and yet foreign at the same time. Most Canadians like myself are steeped in American culture from the moment they can read a sentence, watch a screen, or hum a tune. Likewise, a good deal of what animates American political life is known to Canadians by way of “the news”; after all, it’s important to keep tabs on your neighbour, not least when they happen to be the world’s foremost superpower. There is so much of America in the northern air that it can be difficult at times to pinpoint what exactly constitutes a homegrown cultural or political identity, except in relative terms. It is easier, for example, to cite a popular image of a given region of the US — speaking of Jersey: <em id="""">The Sopranos</em>, anyone? — than it is to come up with even one significant representation of anywhere in Canada. Most Canadians will have some idea of Boston or Brooklyn or even Hoboken. How many Americans can imagine Vancouver? </p><p id="""">On the other hand, some aspects of living stateside can seem outlandish to a Canadian, not to say jarring. I was naïve about how difficult it would be to get around in the sprawl. I had grown used to relying on a combination of carsharing, public transit, and my own two feet. I soon discovered that my suburban corner of New Jersey is situated firmly in car country, and that it is far more convenient to take the train to New York than it is, say, to ride the bus to the grocery store. The idea of a car co-op is baffling in this context. What’s the use when everyone has their own wheels? Pedestrians, too, were clearly the last thing on anyone’s mind when it came to building roads and other infrastructure. (“Designing” would imply too much intention.) I discovered this the hard way when I tried to walk to the movies. The bridge spanning the river — across which lies an AMC multiplex, the only theatre for miles — has a walkway, of course. It’s just that it ends abruptly on the other side, spitting you out onto eight lanes of highway traffic. </p><p id="""">In other respects, a person is simply on their own. A very different paradigm abides in these parts, where medicine, for example, is merely <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/09/congress-healthcare-minimum-wage-education-us-families"" id="""">business by another name</a>. My gut twisted the first time I saw two consecutive ambulances drive by, each with a different private hospital’s logo painted on its side. If it came to it, what illness or injury could I afford to have healed? What would bankrupt me? I knew beforehand that these are the kinds of questions that leave millions of Americans <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/8cca5f8f-89dd-47c0-9c2a-81bce26d48fd"" id="""">starting awake in the middle of the night</a>. I had never known quite what it meant to open my eyes only to keep on living the nightmare. </p><p id="""">Getting mowed over (pardon the expression) and left behind as carrion for the vultures of corporate healthcare is just one form of everyday peril. Because I was stepping back on to campus, I couldn’t help but feel trepidation at the prospect of a shooting. Printed on the backside of my new student ID is the slogan “RUN. HIDE. FIGHT.” No one bothered to explain it: American kids do active-shooter drills <a href=""https://everytownresearch.org/report/the-impact-of-active-shooter-drills-in-schools/"" id="""">from the time they are in kindergarten</a>. (The phrase itself is so commonplace that, a couple of years ago, a thriller was <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11456054/"" id="""">released with it as the title</a>.) One day, while fording the asphalt moat that surrounds my college, I noticed a bumper sticker that read, “EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE THESE TWO THINGS.” Below this was an illustration of a handgun next to a Bible. A couple of states away, in Virginia, two headline-making mass shootings took place in November alone. On the thirteenth, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia opened fire on his classmates, killing three of them. On the twenty-second, a night-shift manager at a Walmart in Chesapeake entered the store’s break room and shot six of his colleagues dead before taking his own life. As I’m writing, a story is breaking of how a six-year-old boy <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/01/06/richneck-elementary-school-gunfire-virginia/"" id="""">shot his teacher</a> in Newport News, also in Virginia. </p><p id="""">Of course, Virginia is not New Jersey, nor is it representative of the country as a whole. In any case, something which hit closer to home had already happened earlier in the same month. On November 3, the FBI in Newark <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/11/03/1134195978/new-jersey-synagogues-threat-fbi"" id="""">issued a warning</a> to all synagogues in the state, saying it had received a credible tip that an individual was menacing the safety of Jewish worshippers. There are no fewer than four synagogues within a fifteen minute’s walk from my apartment, one of which sits at the end of my street. The day after the FBI issued its warning, it <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/nyregion/new-jersey-synagogue-security-threat-suspect.html"" id="""">came out</a> that the individual in question “no longer [posed] a threat to the community.” This rhetoric is ominous enough. But with the likes of the artist formerly known as Kanye West <a href=""https://www.tmz.com/2022/10/19/kanye-west-somewhat-apologizes-for-anti-semitic-comments/"" id="""">brandishing the antisemitic torch</a>, so was the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/12/17/antisemitism-kanye-nyc-attack/"" id="""">national mood</a>. </p><p id="""">Then there was the heat. I thought I had learned to cope, having weathered the deadly “<a href=""https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/blogs/science-health/surviving-heat-impacts-2021-western-heat-dome-canada"" id="""">heat dome</a>” that struck British Columbia a couple of years ago. But little could have prepared me to withstand the summertime temperatures on the East Coast, sustained not just for days but for weeks at or above 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). Unlike my neighbours’ apartments, mine has no AC unit. The lack of cool, shady greenspace — the few public “parks” nearby are little more than glorified lawns — and the abundance of naked concrete made it all the harder to bear. According to data compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, temperatures in New Jersey are <a href=""https://www.njherald.com/story/news/2021/08/30/nj-weather-tops-list-of-states-global-warming/5615695001/'"" id="""">rising the fastest of any state</a>, having gone up by an average of 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.4 degrees Celsius, in the last century. (As you will recall, a key goal of the Paris Agreement is to <a href=""https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement"" id="""">keep the rise in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius</a>.) The latest figures show that even though renewables <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/climate/us-carbon-emissions-2022.html"" id="""">appear to have (just) surpassed coal for the first time</a> last year, fossil fuels still make up the bulk of American energy; in New Jersey, more than half of electric power is <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=NJ"" id="""">generated by burning natural gas</a>. Meanwhile, carbon-dioxide emissions rose 1.3 percent in the US, putting the country back onto its pre-pandemic course — that is, towards doomsday. This increase does not account for the copious fumes <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/climate/wildfire-emissions-climate-change.html"" id="""">belched into the atmosphere by wildfires</a>. </p><p id="""">It is now known that climate change <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/07/14/1015983700/extreme-heat-is-getting-worse-for-low-income-non-white-americans-a-new-study-sho"" id="""">afflicts poor areas more severely</a> than it does wealthy ones. This is true whether speaking globally or locally. Even within the same ZIP code, neglected communities are <a href=""https://peoplesworld.org/article/capitalisms-climate-inequality-the-rich-keep-cool-while-the-poor-roast/"" id="""">likelier to suffer from more punishing heat</a> and to have fewer means of relief than their well-serviced, well-to-do neighbours. As with everything in this country, this tends to correlate with race. The grander, whiter avenues of my borough are lined with tall, leafy trees, and the homes are fronted by dim porches. Meanwhile, the streets below the apartment blocks where working people live, and where Spanish is as often heard as English, are planted sparsely, if at all; a sponge for the heat, the bare pavement soaks up the swelter, spitting it back out well past sunset. In the city across the river, the nineteenth-century Dutch Reformed Church is skirted by a shaded churchyard. Mere blocks away, the angular chapel of the local African Methodist Episcopal congregation sits across from an empty lot, in the shadow of a high rise. </p><p id="""">With next to no alternative to private healthcare or private transportation, and with public resources flattering the interests of private wealth, there is little to buffer the violence of American capitalism. The toll it takes can be seen in the faces of normal people, the “<a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/table/#quarter:129;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:all;units:shares"" id="""">99 percent</a>” who are most vulnerable to its predations. When I started school last September, I found morale among my college’s full-time faculty, in the words of one professor, at an “all-time low.” They had been working without a contract since the summer of 2020, when their union’s prior agreement with the school expired. Since then, the college has been (unsuccessfully) strong-arming the faculty into accepting a four-year contract that would see them receive a zero-percent wage increase in the first year and paltry raises in the rest. With inflation, this means the faculty have been taking repeated cuts to their pay over the past several many months. Though by no means the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/02/another-way-think-about-worker-crisis-americans-work-conditions-are-terrible/"" id="""">worst case</a> (just <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-nursing-care-strikes-covid-4c1c337dbd9727118be6975cf868a626"" id="""">think</a> of <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/14/nurses-strike-staffing-unions/"" id="""">nurses</a>), this scenario was especially dire at the onset of Covid, when they strained to adapt — with neither help nor compensation — to the rigours of remote instruction, and again last summer, when inflation <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/13/us-inflation-new-40-year-high-june-00045541"" id="""">climbed above 9 percent</a> for the first time in 40 years. Meanwhile, the college has recruited a law firm to help fight its own faculty — to the tune of almost a million dollars. The college’s president, who pockets a five-grand pay-bump every year, now draws a salary in excess of $230,000. </p><p id="""">If it seems there is little to love about New Jersey, it is only because, as a homesick outsider, I have been liable to notice some of its worst qualities. While I have grown deeply fond of many of the people I’ve met in my adoptive state, I miss the beauty and the relative humaneness of my West Coast home. This is not to say there is nothing wrong with it. Many of the same ills plague British Columbia: the same <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-nurses-support-training-1.6709136"" id="""">erosion of wages and working conditions</a>, the same <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/parentsvoicebc-endorsing-candidates-1.6597689"" id="""">tendency towards reaction and unreason</a>, the same <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-cirg-injunctions-brewer-1.6713168"" id="""">reliance on extracted resources</a>. Others are unique to the province. Despite the official rhetoric of “<a href=""https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1450124405592/1529106060525"" id="""">reconciliation</a>,” for example, Indigenous peoples across Canada are <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-genocide-is-not-in-canadas-past-it-is-still-happening-to-this-day/"" id="""">still subject to a regime of unabated colonialism</a>. In Jersey, on the other hand, talk of a reckoning with the land’s first peoples is almost unimaginable because the <a href=""https://uofrpress.ca/Books/C/Clearing-the-Plains"" id="""">plains</a> have <a href=""https://www.science.org/content/article/native-tribes-have-lost-99-their-land-united-states"" id="""">long since been cleared</a> — or <a href=""https://nlltribe.com/our-history/"" id="""">nearly so</a>. In the event, this contrast serves to highlight a common feature that both unifies and divides the two places. They are bound together by a common history, the legacy of settler colonialism and the malignant form of capitalism it bore to this continent (and abroad). They are at odds over the value of curbing the spread of the cancer. The one does its best to pretend it isn’t sick at all; the other sees the disease not as an ailment but as a virtue. </p><p id="""">As I write, a long-circulating rumour has just been confirmed as true: despite the mayor’s best efforts, the only grocery store in town is slated to close for good. Online, some residents have speculated about what might be next for the area. The greatest hope for many is that a “plaza,” their euphemism for a strip mall, might replace the grocery. This is frankly the first time I have witnessed anyone express enthusiasm for what I had previously considered a kind of blight. And what about the store’s employees? Apparently, they will be offered the option to transfer to another of the chain’s locations. Locals who accept the offer will face the prospect of a longer commute; in the absence of an all-but-unthinkable overhaul of the transit system, this will hasten a rise in their cost of living due to the extra gas needed to get to and from work. How many will have to weigh fuel against food or healthcare or childcare? I can only imagine that the lack of an accessible place to buy groceries will push many in the area to resort to the likes of Amazon for the delivery of their essentials. As it happens, a monolithic Amazon warehouse sits just down the highway, dwarfing the other industrial buildings nearby; some of my classmates work there part-time to afford tuition. Meanwhile, with all the cars whizzing around, where is there hope for a shift towards a more sustainable way of life? </p><p id="""">Moreover, who can you turn to in order to set things right? Politics might seem the natural field for this type of battle. But in Middlesex County, in contrast to much of the country, the two-party circus isn’t a site of much contestation: Democratic candidates often run unopposed in local elections. So, what to do when the party of “progress” stands in the way of necessary change? The only recourse lies with the people themselves. At first, this prospect may seem dismal. Centuries of propaganda have served to disarm the minds of everyday people on both sides of the border, leaving them abject in the face of their own powerlessness — and all the more susceptible to the lies of charlatans. Yet it is precisely at such a time that things stand a chance of being turned around. The events of the past few years have exposed the brittleness and injustice of American life, and it appears the centre may not hold for much longer. At such a rare time — as in, say, 1968 — the moment is ripe for renewal. It also threatens total collapse. Which way the pendulum swings depends on whether the masses of people on this continent can overcome their proud instinct to stick to themselves and instead come together for the good of all. Nothing short of survival is at stake. In this Canadian’s eyes, this much is clear. Either American civilization bucks the worst of its heritage — or it breaks bad once and for all. </p>",,,<p><strong>Trevor Clarke</strong></p>,"It is a long way from the west coast of Canada to central New Jersey. In August, I moved from the Lower Mainland to Middlesex County, some 35 miles southwest of New York City, and found out just how vast the width of the continent can feel. I traded not just the Pacific for the Atlantic but the city for the suburbs, mountains for flatlands, wilderness for concrete, green for grey. I gave up forests of cedar and spruce and gained (far fewer) oaks and sycamores. I swapped dollars for dollars, the only currency that counts. I left behind the rains only to find myself parched. I was no longer in the land where I was born. I had become an alien. ",false,false,false

We can pull off every Big Idea in the radical playbook — invent true-cost markets, rid politics of secrecy, put corporations in their place, defang Big Finance.</p><p>But unless we get this next part right, none of it will matter. To survive through the 21st century we must come up with a new turn of mind, a new way to . . . inhabit this place.</p><p>*</p><p>Every era has a <em>vibe</em>, an ambiance that permeates our experience. It is the stamp of what it feels like to be alive, the pulse of the zeitgeist. It’s an intangible thing, hard to pin down when you’re in it. But its gravitational pull is so strong that it bends history.</p><p>The beats gave us permission to be wild and carefree. The situationists taught us to live without dead time. The hippies pushed us back into nature. The punks tuned our radar for hypocrisy and our will to resist. The footsoldiers of Occupy Wall Street made us believe that world revolution is possible — and set the tone for what’s to come.</p><p>More recently, movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter have fundamentally changed the way we feel about the most intimate aspects of our daily lives, and what the human contract actually is.</p><p>Art and design movements — from impressionism to Dada, De Stijl to design anarchy — come and go, catching the essential spirit of their time.</p><p>“Many of the great cultural shifts that prepare the way for political change are aesthetic,” J.G. Ballard said, and of course he’s right.</p><p>But now, at the beginning of the 21st century, something feels ominously different. We find ourselves in a planetary endgame, a “code-red emergency” — gripped by an existential tension the world has never seen. This calls for wild, urgent, creative, hair-on-fire innovation. Instead, we have . . . straight-line thinking.</p><p>*</p><p>Last year, I happened to turn on the TV during the baseball playoffs. One team was facing elimination — lose this game and they were done. This team had its best pitcher on the mound, and he was pitching out of his mind. Unhittable. Untouchable. Damn near shamanic. The performance was giving everyone the shivers, no matter which team they were rooting for.</p><p>Then the manager walked out to the mound and pulled him off the game.</p><p>See, the quants in the front office had determined that when a pitch count hits 70, pitchers start to lose their stuff. On average. And so management hedged its bets. It busted in there and broke the spell and killed the magic that was materializing in front of their eyes. They couldn’t see it. They couldn’t <em>feel</em> it.</p><p>In came a new pitcher. And promptly gave up the tying and winning runs. And just like that it was over.</p><p>I thought: <em>This is why the world is imploding</em>. This is what straight-line thinking does: it kills everything it touches. It has no clue about the damage it’s doing.</p><p>Superrationality. The master narrative of life on earth. A holdover from the Enlightenment, with no real course correction in 300 years. It is the worst tool imaginable for the job of pulling off a global mindshift. We shuffle into our apocalyptic circumstances with nothing but our buttoned-down executive brains. We speak in corporate jargon and technobites. Our whole lives crushed down to probabilities, data points, Bayesian calculations. Run the numbers. Protect your priors. Quant it out. You can’t have enough pixels on your phone camera or memory in the cloud.</p><p>We shape our tools, and afterwards our tools shape us. This is where we’ve ended up. The media engines we made have re-made <em>us</em>. We think in algorithms now — some of them sound, some of them unsound, but all of them running by themselves like headless chickens.</p><p>Frederick Hunterwasser famously said, “The straight line is godless and immoral,” and at <em>Adbusters</em> we’ve been coming back to that sentiment again and again because it seems to contain a magical aesthetic secret.</p><p>The logic freaks have had it their way for a very long time and all they have to offer is more of the same: more technology, more rationality, more consumption, more surveillance, more control.</p><p>But now suddenly, up from the greasy boiler room of the heart comes . . . a <em>toneshift</em>! Hyperrationality rolls over and a touch of divine insanity creeps in:</p><p><em>To hell with straight line thinking — let’s learn to wobble again!</em></p><p>This was the conclusion we came to at Adbusters, after we’d put a couple of issues in the can.</p><p>We’d started out as pretty much a clone of other commercial magazines on the newsstands. But we quickly realized that magazines like that were poisoned mindspace, because the ads rule. They disrupt the flow and kill the magic. So our first aesthetic decision was to never run ads.</p><p>Breaking rules is deliciously addictive — you just keep going. Bit by bit over the next few years, we threw out all the conventions of commercial magazine publishing. We killed off the page numbers. (They’re just clumsy interruptions, like pulling out a measuring tape in the middle of sex.) We lost the table of contents, the department heads, the front-of-the-book stuff. (On a fiery mind journey, who needs pronouncements?) We killed the letters section and sprinkled the letters throughout — a very democratic move. We ripped stupid ads out of other magazines and plopped them in, hanging these companies with their own rope. We mucked with punctuation and grammar. (Why be so anal with language?)</p><p>Every which way we could, we abandoned the sanitized, soul-destroying modernist look.</p><p>What <em>was</em> this thing, tattooed with doodles and coffee spills, jammed with random poems and newspaper headlines snipped with sewing scissors? How do you even read it? From front to back or from both ends at once, colliding in the middle? It was more like a movie than a book. We’d grab our readers by the throat on the cover and never let go. We’d create a jump-cut in the human imagination, break the trance of modernism. You pick up the magazine and out falls a blackspot — an anti-logo representing people power. Activists started putting them up on the wall. In the cities they replicated like spores, or mold, nature reclaiming human minds.</p><p>What graphic design needs, we figured, is ten years of total turmoil, fuck-it-all anarchy. After that maybe it would mean something again.</p><p>In that spirit we hatched the <em>First Things First Design Manifesto 2000</em>.</p><p>Thirty years earlier, UK designer Ken Garland had speartipped a crusade basically accusing designers of selling out. Now we recreated his manifesto with a vengeance. We said to designers, Look: You are the most powerful people in the world. You are to the information age what engineers were to the age of steam, what scientists were to the age of reason. You set the mood of the mental environment — the look and lure of print, the tone and pull of TV, the knack and smack of the Net. You are the very <em>form</em> of the culture . . . the typesetters of thought . . . the editors of sentiment. So for chrissake, start acting like it! Unprecedented environmental, social and cultural crises demand that you move away from just the marketing of products and toward the creation of a <em>new kind of meaning</em>. Instead of using your skills and imagination to sell sneakers, detergents, hair gel, butt toners, credit cards, light beer and heavy-duty recreational vehicles — <em>instead of kissing corporate ass</em> — why not break out of the commercial design box and start playing around with the eco- and psycho-dimensions of the <em>product-in-use</em>. Nudge human behavior in new directions. Steer us away from the hubris and self-destructive chaos of the planetary endgame. Design things that raise goosebumps on people’s skin.</p><p>Become a design anarchist! Create the new wobbly vibe that will save the world.</p><p>More than a thousand designers signed our manifesto, including 22 of the biggest names in that world. And as we talked to young designers in the years that followed, we could see their thinking scaling up.</p><p><em>We’ll use recyclable materials.</em></p><p>Nice, but it’s not enough.</p><p><em>We’ll work for nonprofits</em>.</p><p>Okay, but what’s the vision?</p><p><em>We’ll work together to co-create the vibe that stirs people’s souls, disrupts their toxic routines and tips this whole human project toward justice.</em></p><p>Now you’re talking.</p><p>This is the pivot our whole culture now needs to make.</p><p>The aesthetic of our time needs to be kicked out of the orbit of its destructive formalism, its whoring corporate supplication. Dirty it up. Summon the trickster out of the shadows. Scavenge value from the margins, from the stuff we reflexively throw away. Generate an era of tumult that wipes out every remnant of the old vibe.</p><p>“Order has failed so let chaos prevail!”</p><p>And so, the grand reset begins.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Mo —&gt; Pomo —&gt; Nomo</strong></p><p>Modernism laid down the rules — “form follows function” — that programmed a whole century. It built planned cities, tone-deaf buildings, urban social housing that proved so soul-crushing it finally had to be leveled. Monster homes plopped on the seashore, boxes upon boxes, right to the property line, the curve of the shore against the diminished straight-line imagination of developers.</p><p>Pomo arrived as a correction — but it went too far, and the ground turned to liquid under our feet. Everything meant anything so it meant nothing.</p><p>Now we’re on the cusp of a new era. We don’t know what it’s about, don’t even have a name for it yet (maybe Nomo?). All we know is that we’re in a winner-take-all race to find a new story to make sense of our code-red moment. We’ll stumble towards a new sensuality, a new structure of feeling, a new sense of spiritual purpose . . . or we’ll zombie-walk into a new dark age.</p><p>What Nomo <em>won’t</em> be is the popular sci-fi vision of next-level techno-hyperrationalism; that is the wet dream of the logic freaks sliding into China’s social credit model of algorithmic living. More likely Nomo will look to nature for its codes. Biomimicry, ribosomal thinking. Humans insinuating ourselves into the web of the world. It’s like the difference between rowing and sailing. Rowing is brute straight-line effort that seems powerful and efficient, but you’re never going to cross the ocean that way. The secret hack is to tap into the currents and the wind. The solo rower is doomed because as soon as you let go of the oars for even a second, you grind to a halt. But under sail, once you get yourself aligned with the forces of nature, you can lie back and dream.</p><p>In his new book <em>The Day the World Stopped Shopping</em>, J.B. MacKinnon visited the Japanese island of Sado, where type-A Japanese, burned out from life in Tokyo, flee to recover their sanity. Here he heard the word “utori.” It has no direct English translation, but means something like running “below capacity,” having a little slack in the line. Several people defined utori as having “space in your heart.” I am available to you, because I’m not overwhelmed by ratrace demands. I can give you my time and my attention and my energy and my thoughts. Yes, yes. Come on over.</p><p>MacKinnon had been around the world chasing the new post-consumerist vibe that will save us, and he may have found it in this one word. On some level, everyone he’d met who was living an intentionally small, happy, minimally destructive life was positively brimming with utori. You put people first. A spirit of soulful generosity becomes both the bedrock of your private experience and the face you present to the world. People with utori, MacKinnon concluded, “are simply better at being human.”</p><p>As the temperature rises, screws tighten and the doomsday clock approaches midnight, all of us face a moment of reckoning, grappling with the most personal questions there are. Questions like: Would I rather be very rich or very spontaneous? Which person would my children rather be around? Who’s more at peace? Who’s living more softly on the planet?</p><p>People have had it with culture and politics in hyperrational overdrive. They’re done with risk-management software, talking points on teleprompters and expertly concocted carbon-reduction plans that ultimately mean nothing. (That is, they sound good but don’t actually make a dent in the problem.) We ache for proof that full-blooded living is still possible out there.</p><p>I think this explains why sixty million Americans voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>A lot of people were willing to forgive the crazy-ass stuff coming out of his mouth because they were sick of the law-school elites running Washington. They were desperate for someone who shoots from the hip and doesn’t give a damn about making a mistake or being cancelled. Trump walked up to a gaggle of journalists every day like a trumpeter ready to play jazz — with no firm idea of what was going to come out of his horn.</p><p>Miles Davis once said: “The biggest challenge in jazz improvisation is not to play all the notes you could play, but to wait, hesitate — to play what’s not there.”</p><p>Trump did that. And that level of spontaneity was, in his hands, a kind of black magic. That’s what made his base so passionate and his rallies so raucous. It’s how he was able to command incredible loyalty and keep his grubby little fingers on the levers of power.</p><p>Every one of us needs to learn to live a little more like that. When we Lefties demonize Trump, we lose the lesson: If you’re afraid of what the next note will be you’re not going to be able to play it. Pulling punches and playing defense all the time, like we’ve been doing for the past 20 years, that’s not going to get us anywhere. Sooner or later you have to learn how to play jazz and go for it.</p><p><em>One shot, one life!</em></p><p><em>Time of the Magicians</em>, Wolfram Eilenberger’s book about Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Cassirer and Heidegger, had me mesmerized for a good part of the year. I felt that these four men who re-invented philosophy after WW1, were on the same life journey that I was . . . and it was wonderful to walk alongside them for a while.</p><p>But halfway through the book I had a strange epiphany. It occurred to me that all four of them were firmly <em>stuck</em> inside their heads. They thought they could solve all the problems of the world and discover the secret of living good life by swirling things round and round in their brains. Heidegger secluded in his Black Forest hut, Cassirer in his patron’s vast library. Wittgenstein is the most frustrating. Early on, he was fired up about creating useful things in the world — among them an ingenious aircraft engine he designed and patented. Then he met Bertrand Russell at Oxford, and his nimble hands fell still, his brow beetled, and he became an abstract thinker, committed to logic. He was never able to break out of his anxious brooding.</p><p><em>My</em> god, I thought: could this kind of obsessive thinking — our default mode since Aristotle, Pythagoras and Plato over two thousand years ago and the one Descartes captured in five words: <em>I Think Therefore I Am</em> — be the fatal flaw of Western civilization? Could this be where we veered off course . . . where we fell into the trap of <em>thinking</em> that we can <em>think</em> our way out of everything?</p><p>Now after finishing the book, I believe we must pass over much of the thinking these four men did in silence. Yes, they made some stunning conceptual breakthroughs, but their playbook has outlived its usefulness. Our obsession with head-down, nose-to-the-stone logical analysis may no longer be fit to solve the multiple existential crises that now confront us.</p><p>Maybe the vibe of the 21st century will reveal itself when we take the leap from</p><p><em>I Think Therefore I Am —&gt; I Connect Therefore I Am</em></p><p>*</p><p>The way forward for humanity may well turn out to be a new mode of guerrilla activism, one that’s less about street fighting and more about spiritual insurrection.</p><p>Maybe we will simply let go . . . cultivate a certain looseness of mind . . . “<em>Live suddenly without thinking</em>,” as e. e. cummings put it . . . and fall into whatever comes next.</p><p>Which is what?</p><p>Nobody knows . . . but it’s tantalizing to speculate.</p><p>Maybe we’ll start reversing a lot of things . . . shed many of the constraints we never asked for and choose their opposite. The stuff of the real world over digital simulacra. Traditions over fads, mystery over certainty, pathos over logos, listening over pontificating, child’s play over exegesis, the collective over the individual, yin over yang, sharing over consuming, the long-time horizons of the planet over quick payoffs and indulged cravings.</p><p>Maybe as the techno-rationalist Western vibe wilts at the task before it, the so-called WEIRD vibe of the rest-of-the-world — communitarianism, family, tradition, faith — will rise as an alternative.</p><p>Maybe the new vibe will be a <em>maker</em> vibe — more about creating (which makes you powerful) than about consuming (which gives away your power).</p><p>Maybe we’ll opt for small rather than imposing things. Muted colors. Understatement. Not the action but that pregnant moment before the action.</p><p>Maybe we’ll abandon the spectacle . . . and revel instead in the intimacies of everyday life: the touch of a lover, a chat with a bright-eyed stranger, a quiet moment in the wild?</p><p>Maybe the old American dream about prosperity will morph into a new one about spontaneity?</p><p>Maybe we’ll learn to start having . . . fun again. Just crazy, uninhibited fun. (Where did <em>that</em> go?)</p><p>Whatever form it ultimately takes, one thing is clear: Nomo is the project of our century. And in its emergence, just maybe, will be the answer to a question that has not yet been answered: Is capitalism with empathy even possible?</p><p>One thing is certain: If we don’t get it right, if we cannot recover our innate empathy, find balance and come up with a new tone, a new ambience, a new aesthetic to live by, then it will be a century of hubris, brutality and mayhem on a scale the world has never seen.</p><p>— Excerpted from Adbusters’ forthcoming book.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/625092a83183e2bd5ce41ae8_toneshift.jpg,,<p>Third Force</p>,"One thing is certain.

I became a gardener; I was not alone. The global spread of green thumb, which tracked intimately with the tally of Covid infections as they rose and dipped and rose anew, is <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-pandemics-gardening-boom-shows-how-gardens-can-cultivate-public-health-181426"" id="""">well documented</a>. Since the unpromising start of the new decade, everyone and their aunt’s nosey neighbour seem to have taken up a spade or a trowel and sunk their fingers into some soil, if only to the depth of a window box. I was there alongside them, forging — as perhaps a few of my fellow horticulturalists consciously did — a new relationship to my political commitments as much as to the earth. All it took were a handful of seeds and a willingness to get dirty. </p><p id="""">The phenomenon of the pandemic-born gardener, to my mind, makes all too much sense. I’m far from the only one to know firsthand how the days and weeks and months of at-home confinement could drive a person outdoors and into the ground. It wasn’t just a hankering to be outside so much as a need to affirm a reality beholden to physical change and earthly rhythms that did it for me. The feeling of never-ending, screen-mediated monotony, the dawn of each new day portending yet another “<a href=""https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/it-s-not-just-you-lockdowns-had-us-living-in-blursday-study-says-70422"" id="""">Blursday</a>,” made me long to mark the passing of time in a way that felt meaningful rather than dreary, arbitrary, aimless. It seemed only natural to have found a sort of calendar of significance in the surge and retreat of the seasons. In a word, by going back to the soil, this modern creature went pagan. </p><p id="""">But this was merely the seed, so to speak, of my newfound conviction. By taking stock of the natural cycle of bloom and decay with more attention than ever before, I learned to notice beauty not just in the spectacle of flowers and the trill of birdsong but in the drunken milling of gnats, in the seedlings as they suckled on the morning light, in the rich smell of rotting leaves, in the might of bulging roots breaching the pavement, in the tenderness of burrowing bees, in the tenacity of weeds. To care about plants is to care about the wasp that eats the slug, the worm that churns the soil, the squirrel that plants the nut, the hummingbird that pollinates the blossom. It is to cast your lot with the forces of life — not just human life but life on the scale of species, communities, ecosystems, the planet itself. </p><p id="""">It is also to take the side of the future. If the soil is spent, then nothing can grow; if nothing can grow, then no one can eat. If no one can eat, then the persistence of our species — to say nothing of others — is a moot point. To invest in the lives of plants and the conditions that allow them to thrive is thus to contemplate a timescale reaching beyond the immediate, even beyond the human lifespan. It might mean nursing a sapling that will mature to shade not yours but other generations. It might imply, instead of rashly depleting the limited resources at hand in a glut of productivity, the upkeeping of an environment favourable for cultivation for years and decades to come. Further, it might demand acknowledging the means of tending plants as something inherently communal, and their longevity as depending closely on the cooperation of multitudes — animal and vegetal, human and nonhuman. Nothing, after all, can flourish in isolation; in the garden, mutual aid is a first principle. </p><p id="""">Now consider not just the productive kind of gardening but the explicitly unproductive kind. I’m talking about growing blossom-laden trees, tall grasses, draping vines, feathery ferns, variegated fronds, fragrant herbs — plants with a purely decorative, or sensual, purpose. It would be easy to dismiss this kind of planting, in contrast to the kind that yields masses of edible matter, as frivolous. After all, even a front lawn fully transformed into a vegetable plot cannot, in all but the most exceptional cases, sustain an amateur gardener without supplementation. But this sort of activity is far from fruitless: you do it, of course, because it gives you pleasure. Delighting in the unsaleable, the unmarketable, the uncommodified, the economically pointless or “valueless” is far more radical than it might seem. In a world that demands that everything have its price, in a culture that deems consumption the ultimate arbiter of worth, it is an act of subversion, even of resistance, to spend your time and your efforts in the garden, expending little or no money and producing nothing of any value to anyone but yourself. To defend this kind of pleasure is to defend life itself against the forces of unfettered capitalism — that is, against what has been gradually throttling the very possibility of life ever since the onset of its fossil-fuelled industrial stage in the nineteenth century. </p><p id="""">Most of what I’m saying is pretty neatly summed up in George Orwell’s essay “<a href=""https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/some-thoughts-on-the-common-toad/"" id="""">Some Thoughts on the Common Toad</a>,” which he wrote for <em id="""">Tribune </em>in 1946. Orwell was passionate in the garden, as he was about nature generally. In the essay, he praises the springtime spawn of toads — to him, an overlooked subject for aesthetic appreciation. A handful of years before the time of its writing, London had been blitzed to rubble; but even in the city’s then bombed-out state, as Orwell describes it, life found a way. “Suddenly, towards the end of March, the miracle happens and the decaying slum in which I live is transfigured,” he writes: </p><blockquote id="""">Down in the square the sooty privets have turned bright green, the leaves are thickening on the chestnut trees, the daffodils are out, the wallflowers are budding … and even the sparrows are quite a different colour, having felt the balminess of the air and nerved themselves to take a bath, their first since last September. </blockquote><p id="""">It isn’t mere sentimentalism that leads Orwell to savour these sights. After all, he asks, “if we kill all pleasure in the actual process of life, what sort of future are we preparing for ourselves?” To Orwell, admiring the beauty of natural things, even the lowly toad, is a first, necessary step towards ensuring the planet is a place where we might have a chance of eking out a “decent” existence, to use a pet word of his. It is a vision of the future characterized not by over-lofty principles but by plain-old compassion. It is therefore an ideal in less danger than others of succumbing to the compromising rhetoric of the campaign, the slogan, the ideology, the in-group, the dogma, the dogmatist, the dictator, the death machine. Like weeds, these are still with us: they have yet to be rooted out. </p><p id="""">It strikes me that gardening, in a way, is the opposite of extraction. It is generation instead of destruction, respect instead of disdain, preservation instead of despoilation, mending instead of severing, healing instead of mutilation. It is harmony instead of war — “swords into ploughshares,” and all that. It entails a way of looking at things that is attentive and humane, life-affirming and pleasure-seeking, caring and even loving. Gardening alone cannot solve all our problems; it cannot save us from the peril we have set upon ourselves. But it can teach us to set store by the living things that give us life even as we make life possible for them. Gardens, too, are places to reclaim the calm, if not the perspective, lost in an age of total commodification and constant surveillance, when we are facing down our doom. They are places outside the algorithm and removed from the infostreams. And they might just be the spaces that allow us to discover a different way of dwelling together, on the small planet we can’t help but share. If this all doesn’t contain the kernel of a political awakening, I don’t know what would. But what can I say? I just want to watch the world bloom. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/63bdf196d526b73c16c25a52_Jonathan_Kemper_Unsplash_600.jpg,,"<p id="""">Trevor Clarke - <a href=""https://subscribe.adbusters.org/"">Adbusters 164</a></p>","Over the last two years, I have developed one of the most politically clarifying of all my habits.

The hope is that each small advance is a piece of the puzzle, and a fair, just, sustainable and secure global system will emerge if we all just commit to reducing carbon emissions through every hack we can think of.</p><p>But let’s get real: Things are too precarious to continue to play the same game more intensely. </p><p>The late Stanford philosopher Paul Watzlawick had a way of explaining the thinking required to get out of impossible jams. </p><p>A “first-order” change is to stamp on the gas pedal. A second-order change is to shift gears. A third-order change is to get out of the car and find another way to get there.</p><p>That’s where we are now.</p><p>*</p><p>If you burrow deep into the innards of the capitalist algorithm, you’ll find a major flaw. It’s that the vast majority of humankind’s carbon emissions are unpriced. Out of the trillions of transactions made every day in the global marketplace, only a tiny fraction reflect their true cost. From the tires on our cars, to the phones in our hands, to the Big Macs nesting in napkins in take-out bags, e<em>very purchase we make is essentially a mistake. </em>And each one drives us a little closer to global system collapse.</p><p>With every bogus transaction, another drop of meltwater slides off an iceberg, another puff of CO2 rises to the sky, another bubble of methane burps from the tundra. If we keep repeating that mistake, trillions of times a day, week after week, month after month, year after year, what do you think will happen?</p><p>Economists speak the language of efficiency, and they’ve taught the whole world to do the same. But why are so many economists silent on these, the greatest inefficiencies of all? Why are we selling off our natural capital and calling it income? Why is the profession of economics, when it should be rushing into the breach to lead us, so monumentally negligent? </p><p>Economists, this is your new brief. Let’s figure this out. What is the real cost of shipping a container load of toys from Chongqing to Los Angeles? Or a case of apples grown in New Zealand to markets in North America? And what is the true cost of that fridge humming 24/7 in your kitchen? That steak sizzling on your grill? That car rolling off the production line? How much are the byproducts of our way of living actually setting us back?</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>The Road To True Cost </strong></h2><p>The new accounting starts with the little stuff: plastic bags, coffee cups, paper napkins. Let’s say the eco costs turn out to be five cents per plastic bag, ten cents per cup and a fraction of a cent per paper napkin. We tack those on. Of course we’re already doing that with the various eco-fees and eco-taxes included in the price of tires, cans of paint and other products. But now we abandon the concept of ancillary fees and taxes and start implementing true-cost pricing from cradle to doorstep, across the board.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True Cost Plastic</strong></h2><p>How much plastic is coming out of the industrial bunghole annually? We ask economists to spin up a rough number. Say it’s a trillion tons. Then they make their best guess at the environmental price we pay for our clogged garbage dumps, polluted oceans and the shitspray of plastic microbeads through the food chain – say it’s $500 per ton. Every manufacturer, corporation and retailer that uses plastic in their business will be required to account for that. Maybe it’s a surcharge of a quarter on every bottle of Coke. Coca Cola can’t take a hit like that on their margin. They’ll have to change their business model. Likewise, the automobile industry will have to redesign their cars. Food producers will have to adapt. </p><p>The cost of living will rise, and that’ll hurt. But plastic packaging will gradually disappear from our lives. We’ll buy our milk in glass bottles and bring them in for recycling like we used to. We’ll wash our plates, knives and forks and use them year after year, some for a lifetime. The garbage gyres in the oceans will shrink and finally disappear. Blight will vanish from beaches and ravines. Microplastics will stop plugging the tissues of every mammal including us. And the horror of bringing our children up in a world awash in plastic will be over.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True Cost Driving</strong></h2><p>Once we add on the environmental cost of carbon emissions, the cost of building and maintaining roads, the medical costs of accidents, the noise and the aesthetic degradation of urban sprawl, your private automobile will cost you around $100,000, and a tank of gas $150. You’ll still be free to drive all you want, but instead of passing the costs on to future generations, you’ll pay up front. </p><p>Plenty of people will howl and moan – at least in the beginning. A bitter meme war will be fought about how true cost disproportionally punishes the poor. But once true-cost pricing is in place, car use will plunge and bicycle use will soar. City skies will be clearer. Breathing easier. Ride sharing will spike. People will live closer to work. Demand for monorails, bullet trains, subways and streetcars will surge. A paradigm shift in urban planning will calm the pace of urban living. Cities will be built for people, not cars. Catastrophic weather events like hurricanes, floods and superfires will subside. The spectre of global warming won’t feel so ominous anymore.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True Cost Eating</strong></h2><p>We tally the hidden costs of our industrial farming and food-processing systems. We raise the price of groceries to reflect the true cost of shipping them long distances. An avocado from Mexico will cost you $15. You won’t be able to indulge so often. And that shrimp from Indonesia? Once the eco devastation of mega-farming and container shipping are added on, it will run you about $35 a pound. A Whopper with cheese will quadruple in price. So will most meats, produce and processed foods. You can still eat whatever you want, but you’ll have to pay the real tab. Inevitably, your palate will submit to your wallet. But the cost of organic and locally produced food will go down, nudging us all in that direction. Local farmers will be celebrated. We’ll grow tomatoes on our verandas, eat at home more and maybe lose some weight and be a little healthier. Bit by bit, purchase by purchase, our global food system will heave toward sustainability.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>True Cost Shipping</strong></h2><p>For years it’s been ridiculously cheap to use mega tankers to ship stuff across the ocean. All that will stop. Our current way of exporting and importing goods, the one economists have been touting as a way to spur growth but which depends on a mightily subsidized transportation system, will no longer fly. Globalization — capitalism’s bred-in-the-bone burden — will cease to be the dominant economic paradigm. Just about everything at the megamarts will cost more. The whole tenor of world trade will be transformed. Exports and imports will stabilize at a reduced level. Trillions of purchases every day will come back to your neighborhood.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Next-level Accounting: The Social and Psychic Costs</h2><p>You’re cruising along an eight-lane highway and suddenly everything lurches to a halt. There’s a lot more going on here than a heft blast of carbon emissions. A traffic jam is a huge collective stress event. There are health costs to being pinned in your car, on a dammed river of steel, fingers tightening on the wheel, blood pressure rising. Mental health costs too. A recent Swedish study found that a daily commute to work of forty-five minutes or longer increases your chance of divorce by 40 percent. </p><p>What is the psychic cost of advertising, that daily broadside of pro-consumption messages? Or the mental toll of continually checking your phone — bridling against Big Tech’s surveillance algorithms, over and over and over? Or the social and psychological cost of losing the indie shops in your neighborhood as Starbucks, Home Depot and Walmart muscle their way in. All this is part of the True Cost story — and so must eventually be part of the final accounting — of the epidemic of mental illness now sweeping the planet.</p><p>* </p><p>For conventional economists, True Cost is a gut punch. A True-Cost Marketplace would slow growth, reduce the flow of world trade and curb consumption. It would force economists to rethink just about every axiom they’ve taken for granted since the dawn of the industrial age. </p><p>The efficiency of size would be challenged. The hidden cost of Walmart coming to town, revealed. The lie of never-ending growth on a finite planet, exposed. &nbsp;</p><p>“Progress” itself would be redefined.</p><p>There would even be angels-on-a-pin debates about the psychological and social costs of individualism.</p><p>True Cost could turn out to be one of the most traumatic and painful economic / social / cultural projects we have ever undertaken. </p><p>But also one of the most transformative.</p><p>In a True-Cost world, there’d be no need for pleading and hectoring, no need to wallow in conflicting consumer emotions. No one would be badgering you to eat less meat. No one would make you feel guilty about owning a car, or for going on that holiday to the Bahamas. All you’re being asked to do is become a consumer in a new kind of marketplace. &nbsp;</p><p>Instead of “lowest price wins, and don’t ask too many questions,” Adam Smith’s invisible hand would start working its magic in surprising new ways. We’d become part of a worldwide <em>process</em> in which every one of the trillions of transactions made every day are working <em>for</em> rather than against us.</p><p>Only a handful of economists have bothered to think of externalities as anything but marginalia — a few paragraphs in Gregory Mankiw’s <em>Principles of Economics </em>textboo<em>k. </em>This would remake the entire profession. True Cost would put a shine on the dismal science. It would <em>ground </em>economists, give them something <em>real </em>to do. It would create a virtuous, progressive occupation out of a retrograde one. The profession would become something a young grad would be proud to devote their whole life to. Environmentally minded students would be streaming into Econ 101 because economics is the <em>Queen of the Sciences </em>now, incorporating sociology, anthropology and psychology. It’s the essential discipline for working our way out of our existential crisis.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>How To Put It in Place</h2><p>Implementing a global True Cost marketplace would actually be quite simple. It could be made to work through the UPC code that’s already on just about every product sold around the world. When you swipe it, a true-cost price adjustment automatically kicks in. All the ecological costs of making and marketing and shipping and distributing that thing you’re buying are baked in to the price. <em>One swipe, one truth.</em> Sticker shock: take it or leave it. </p><p>‍</p><h2>How To Spend the Money</h2><p>True Cost would generate a vast pool of income — probably in the trillions of dollars a year. Agreeing on how to spend it would no doubt be a messy, angry, contentious affair. It may well torpedo the whole project. But it could also turn into a beautiful collective brainstorm. Humanity’s joint endeavor. The birth of a global mind, with the stakes as high as they go: our very survival. </p><p>The True Cost bounty would amount to a kind of global superfund. Money would flow to each nation, based on its population, to spend as it sees fit.</p><p>Many countries might choose to plow it into priority projects to help them reach their carbon reduction goals. Others might decide to bounce some, or even all of it, directly back to the taxpayers. A hefty check would arrive periodically in the mail, as compensation. People agree to take the pain up front, knowing relief will come.</p><p>The nations of the world may agree to pool some of the money into a <em>Global Emergency Relief Fund</em>, to be spent by the United Nations and NGOs when calamities occur. For the always cash-strapped UN and relief organizations, and for people anywhere in the world who suddenly cannot cope, that would be a godsend.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Is True Cost a Pipedream?</strong></h2><p>True Cost? Great idea! But it’s never gonna work. </p><p>That’s what they all say.</p><p>I get it. Nothing of this scope, on this scale, has ever been tried. It feels like about Plan D — after all the more ‘sensible,’ green-energy and techno options have been kicked around.</p><p>And our record of working together is pretty dismal. Look how we handled Covid. We couldn’t come up with a coherent global thrust to beat it back. Or to distribute the vaccines. Hell, some of us couldn’t even agree to wear masks.</p><p>But the global mood will change as our planet overheats. Ecological collapse is a slow-motion catastrophe. You don’t <em>feel </em>it yet, you can’t apprehend the urgency of it. Because your hair isn’t on fire. Yet. </p><p>But once we pass a tipping-point — and we’ll absolutely know it when it happens — when resource skirmishes erupt into full-scale wars, and slow violence turns into fast violence, and suddenly it’s <em>your</em> children who are hungry and <em>your </em>house that’s being swept away and <em>your </em>country that’s at war . . . that’s when you’ll forget “never gonna work” and reach for the ax on the wall.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Winning the Planetary Endgame</strong></h2><p>Sometime in the third decade of the 21st century, as Earth registers a rise of two or three degrees and we contemplate the possibility of total civilizational collapse, the world will be ready for a monumental pivot.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:900px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""900px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/60a8187ece978f3a56db99f8_truecost_manifesto.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h2><strong>The Green Coalition</strong> </h2><p>We put True Cost on the platforms of all the Green Parties of the world.

Cela concerne tous les pays avec l’espoir que chaque petite avancée soit une pièce du puzzle. Alors un système global, juste, équitable et soutenable émergerait si nous réussissions à réduire nos émissions de carbone, par quelque moyen que ce soit.</p><p>Mais soyons réaliste: la situation est trop critique pour continuer le même jeu avec toujours plus d’intensité. Suivant l’allégorie de Paul Watzlawick, philosophe à Stanford, aujourd’hui décédé: face au mur, faut-il appuyer sur l’accélérateur, changer de vitesse ou sortir de la voiture? C’est la situation où nous sommes aujourd’hui. </p><p>*</p><p>Si on se plonge au cœur de l’algorithme du capitalisme, on découvre un défaut fondamental: la très grande majorité des émissions de carbone d’origine humaine ne sont pas comptabilisées. Des mille milliards de transactions journalières effectuées sur les marchés, seulement une minuscule portion reflète leur vrai coût. Des pneus de notre voiture au smartphone dans notre main, en passant par les hamburgers des fastfood, chacun de nos achats est entaché d’une erreur fondamentale d’appréciation. Et chacun nous conduit plus près de l’effondrement.</p><p>Avec chaque transaction trompeuse, une nouvelle goutte d’eau coule d’un glacier en fonte, une &nbsp;nouvelle quantité de CO2 est injectée dans l’atmosphère, une nouvelle bulle de méthane s’échappe de la tundra. Si nous continuons suivant cette même inconséquence des millions de fois chaque jour, semaine après semaine, mois après mois, année après année, que pensez-vous qu’il arrivera? </p><p>Les économistes parlent le langage de l’efficacité et ils demandent au monde entier de s’y plier également. Mais pourquoi les économistes sont-ils silencieux sur cela, sur cette inefficacité fondamentale. Pourquoi dilapidons-nous notre capital naturel tout en appelant cela un revenu? Pourquoi la science économique, quand elle devrait se plonger dans cette faille systémique pour nous en sortir, est-elle si &nbsp;monstrueusement négligente?</p><p>Économistes, voici votre nouvel ordre de mission, merci de prendre cela en compte. Quel est le coût réel d’envoyer à Los Angeles un navire porte-conteneurs rempli de jouets fabriqués à Chongqing? Ou une caisse de pommes de Nouvelle-Zélande vers les marchés européens? Et quel est le vrai coût d’un frigidaire bourdonnant 24h/24 7j/7 dans une cuisine? Et ce bifteck en train de cuire sur le gril? Et cette automobile avançant sur la chaîne de production? Quels sont les coûts cachés de notre mode de vie, et dont les impacts sont destructeurs?</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>La voie vers un CoûtVrai</strong></h2><p>La nouvelle comptabilité débute par les petites choses: les sacs plastiques, les tasses de café jetables, les serviettes en papier. Estimons le coût écologique à 5 centimes par sac plastique, à 10 centimes par tasse jetable et à une fraction de centime par serviette papier. Nous ajoutons ces coûts. Bien sûr, c’est ce que nous faisons déjà avec les diverses écotaxes comprises dans le prix des pneus, des pots de peinture et autres produits. Mais maintenant, abandonnons les concepts de frais annexes, de taxes, et commençons à implémenter un prix basé sur le vrai coût à tous les niveaux et sur l’ensemble des étapes de production.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>LeCoûtVrai du plastique</strong></h2><p>Quelle quantité de plastique est-elle produite par l’industrie chaque année? Nous demandons aux économistes d’estimer un prix approximatif. Disons mille milliards de tonnes. Ensuite, ils doivent estimer au mieux le prix environnemental que nous payons par nos décharges débordantes, par les océans pollués et la plaie que représentent les microbilles de plastique dans toute la chaîne alimentaire –disons 500 dollars &nbsp;par tonne. Chaque fabricant, entreprise ou détaillant qui utilise du plastique dans sonactivité devra en tenir la comptabilité. Peut-être cela représente-t-il un surcoût d’un quart sur chaque bouteille de Coca-Cola. L’entreprise ne pourra pas supporter une telle entaille dans ses marges. Elle devra réviser son business model. De la même manière, l’industrie automobile devra revoir la conception de ses voitures. Les compagnies agroalimentaires devront s’adapter.</p><p>Le coût de la vie augmentera et ce sera douloureux. Mais les emballages plastiques disparaîtront petit à petit de nos vies. Nous achèterons le lait dans des bouteilles en verre qui seront reprises en consigne. Nous laverons nos assiettes, couteaux et fourchettes et les réutiliserons années après années, parfois toute la vie. Le tourbillon de déchets dans les océans diminuera et finalement, il disparaîtra. &nbsp;Les déchets encombrant les espaces naturels disparaîtront. Les micro-particules de plastique cesseront de perturber les tissus des organismes de chaque mammifère, dont nous-même. Et l‘angoisse d’élever nos enfants dans un monde rempli de plastique aura disparu.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>LeCoût Vrai de la voiture individuelle</strong></h2><p>Avec l’ajout du coût environnemental des émissions de carbone, du coût de la construction et de l’entretien des routes, du coût médical des accidents, du bruit et de la dégradation esthétique due à l’étalement urbain, votre automobile individuelle vous coûtera aux alentours de 100 000 dollars et 150 dollars pour un plein d’essence. Vous serez toujours libre de conduire à votre guise, mais plutôt que de passer le coût aux générations futures, vous allez le payer directement. &nbsp;De très nombreuses personnes vont hurler et s’opposer, au moins au début. On dira que cette histoire de coût vrai est une punition pour les classes les moins favorisées de la population. Mais une fois en place, la facturation au coût vrai fera plonger l’utilisation de la voiture individuelle tandis que l’usage du vélo s’étendra. L’atmosphère dans les villes sera plus transparente, la respiration plus facile. Le covoiturage se développera encore. Les gens habiteront plus près de leur lieu de travail. La demande &nbsp;pour les trains, TGV, métros et tramways gonflera. Un changement de paradigme dans la planification des villes apaisera de rythme de la vie urbaine. Les villes seront bâties pour les gens, non plus pour les voitures. Les événements climatiques catastrophiques, comme les ouragans, les inondations, ainsi que les incendies géants, diminueront. Le spectre du réchauffement climatique ne sera plus aussi obsédant.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Manger au Coût Vrai</strong></h2><p>Il nous faut évaluer les coûts cachés des fermes industrielles et de l’industrie agro-alimentaire. Le prix des articles alimentaires doit augmenter pour tenir compte du vrai coût du transport sur de longues distances. Un avocat venant du Mexique vous coûtera 15 dollars. Vous ne pourrez pas en profiter aussi souvent qu’aujourd’hui. Et cette crevette &nbsp;d’Indonésie? Une fois la dévastation écologique des méga-industries alimentaires et des bateaux porte-conteneurs prise en compte, les crevettes afficheront environ 35 dollars la livre. &nbsp;Un hamburger avec fromage verra quadrupler son prix. Il en sera de même pour la plupart des produits carnés et de l’alimentation transformée. Vous pourrez toujours manger ce que vous voudrez mais il faudra en payer la facture. Inévitablement, votre palais s’ajustera à votre porte-monnaie. Mais les coûts des produits naturels et locaux iront diminuant, nous entraînant tous dans cette direction. Les paysans locaux seront à la fête. Nous cultiverons des tomates dans notre véranda, mangerons plus souvent à la maison et peut-être perdrons-nous un peu de poids et serons-nous en meilleure santé. Petit à petit, achat après achat, notre système alimentaire global s’approchera de la soutenabilité.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Le Coût Vrai du fret maritime</strong></h2><p>Depuis des années, il est ridiculement bon marché d’envoyer des marchandises par navires porte-conteneurs au travers des océans. Cela cessera. Notre manière actuelle d’exporter et importer &nbsp;des biens, ce système que les économistes ont loué comme le moyen de stimuler la croissance mais qui dépend d’un système de transports massivement subventionnés, finira par être mis à l’arrêt. La globalisation –ce carburant du capitalisme –cessera d’être le paradigme économique dominant. Presque tous les biens vendus en grande surface coûteront davantage. Le commerce mondial sera totalement transformé. Les exportations et importations se stabiliseront à un niveau réduit. Des milliards d’achats quotidiens redeviendront des transactions locales.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Une autre comptabilité : les coûts sociaux et psychologiques</strong></h2><p>Vous conduisez le long d’une autoroute à huit voies et soudain la circulation s’arrête. Ils se passe plus ici qu’une exorbitante émission de gaz carbonique. Un embouteillage est un grand événement de stress collectif. Il y a des coûts de santé qui se rapportent à la voiture, à cette rivière d’acier, les mains serrées sur le volant, et la pression sanguine qui s’élève. Il y a un coût mental aussi. Une récente étude suédoise a déterminé qu’un trajet quotidien de 45 minutes pour se rendre au travail augmente les chances de divorce de 40%.</p><p>Quel est le coût psychique de la publicité, cette flopée quotidienne de messages pro-consommation? &nbsp;Et le coût mental de continuellement vérifier son téléphone -tout en tentant d’échapper à la surveillance par les Big Tech -toujours et encore? &nbsp;Ou le coût social et psychologique de voir ses magasins alternatifs locaux disparaître alors que Starbucks, Home Depot et Walmart se renforcent toujours. Tout ceci fait partie de l’histoire du Coût Vrai –et doit donc faire partie du bilan final –et de l’épidémie de difficultés mentales balayant l’ensemble du monde. </p><p>*</p><p>Pour les économistes conventionnels, le Coût Vrai est un coup au ventre. Un marché basé sur des prix sincères ralentirait la croissance, réduiraitle flux du commerce mondial et diminuerait la consommation. Cela forcerait les économistes à revoir chaque axiome qu’ils tenaient pour acquis depuis l’aube de l’âge industriel. L’efficacité de la production en masse serait remise en cause. Les coûts cachés de Walmart seraient révélés. Le mensonge &nbsp;de la croissance infinie dans un monde fini apparaîtrait pour ce qu’il est.</p><p>Le «progrès» lui-même serait à redéfinir.</p><p>Il y aurait des débats savants à propos du coût psychologique et social de l’individualisme.</p><p>Le Coût Vrai pourrait se révéler être le projet le plus traumatique et douloureux que &nbsp;nous ayons jamais entrepris des points de vue économique, social, culturel. </p><p>Mais aussi l’un des plus transformatifs.</p><p>Dans un monde basé sur le coût vrai, il n’y aurait plus besoin de plaider ni de mener campagne. Fini le malaise moral lié à la consommation. Plus personne ne vous culpabiliserait à propos du dégât environnemental de la consommation de viande. Plus personne ne vous culpabiliserait de posséder une voiture ou de partir en vacances aux Bahamas. Tout ce qui vous est demandé est de devenir un consommateur dans un nouveau genre de système. Plutôt que «achetez au moins cher et ne vous posez pas trop de questions», la main invisible du marché selon Adam Smith commencerait à produire ses effets de manière surprenante et nouvelle. Nous ferions partie d’un système global dans lequel chacune des &nbsp;mille milliards de transactions réalisées chaque jour fonctionnerait <em>pour </em>nous, plutôt que contre nous. </p><p>Une poignée d’économistes seulement se sont évertués à penser les externalités autrement que comme une question marginale –quelques paragraphes dans les Principes d’Économie &nbsp;de Gregory Mankiw. Cela redéfinirait complètement le métier. Le Coût Vrai remettrait du brillant à une sombre science. Cela replacerait les économistes dans la réalité, avec quelque chose de concret à entreprendre. Une occupation vertueuse et progressiste renaîtrait à la place &nbsp;de l’ancienne, rétrograde. La profession deviendrait quelque chose à quoi de jeunes étudiants seraient fiers de consacrer leur vie. Les étudiants sensibles aux questions environnementales viendraient s’inscrire au cours d’initiation en économie car l’économie serait la reine des sciences, incluant de la sociologie, de l’anthropologie et de la psychologie. Ce serait la discipline essentielle pour nous sortir de la crise existentielle actuelle.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Comment mettre cela en place</strong></h2><p>Mettre en œuvre un marché global basé sur le Coût Vrai &nbsp;serait en fait assez simple. Cela pourrait passer par l’utilisation du code universel des produits, code déjà existant sur chaque produit vendu au travers le monde. Quand vous le scannez, le juste prix apparaît automatiquement. Tous les coûts écologiques de la fabrication, du marketing, du fret et de la distribution du produit que vous êtes en train d’acheter sont intégrés dans le prix. Un s<em>can, une &nbsp;réalité. </em>Le choc de l’étiquette: à prendre ou à laisser.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Comment dépenser l’argent </strong></h2><p>Le Coût Vrai générerait un vaste revenu –certainement de l’ordre de mille milliards de dollars l’année. Se mettre d’accord sur l’affectation de cet argent serait sans doute une affaire difficile, âpre et contestée, à tel point que cela pourrait anéantir le projet dans son ensemble. Mais cela pourrait aussi être l’occasion d’un beau brainstorming collectif, d’un effort conjoint de l’humanité entière. La naissance d’un esprit global, aux enjeux aussi élevés que cela: notre survie même. Le magot du Coût Vrai serait un genre de super fonds global. L’argent coulerait sur chaque nation, en fonction de sa population, à dépenser suivant ses plans.</p><p>De nombreux pays pourraient choisir d’orienter cet argent vers des projets, jugés prioritaires, leur permettant d’atteindre leurs objectifs de réduction carbone. D’autres pourraient décider de redistribuer une partie de la somme, ou même le total, directement en réductions d’impôts. Un chèque conséquent arriverait par conséquent en compensation dans les boites aux lettres. Les gens accepteraient la difficulté de la mesure sachant qu’une compensation arriverait.</p><p>Les pays pourraient orienter &nbsp;une partie de l’argent vers un <em>Fond global d’aide d’urgence,</em>pris en charge par les Nations unies ou des ONG, à utiliser quand une calamité se produit. Pour les Nations unies et les ONG, toujours à courtd’argent, et pour les populations partout dans le monde et qui soudain, ne peuvent plus faire face, cela serait comme un cadeau du ciel. </p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Le Coût Vrai est-il une chimère?</strong></h2><p>Le Coût Vrai? Super idée! Mais ça ne marchera jamais.</p><p>C’est ce qu’ils disent tous.C’est sûr. Rien de tel, à cette échelle, n’a jamais été essayé. Cela ressemble comme à un plan D –après que toutes les solutions plus «raisonnables», les énergies vertes et autres options technologiques, aient été essayées.</p><p>De plus, nos expériences passées d’un accord entre nations sont plutôt lamentables. Regardez comment a été traité la Covid 19. Les gens ne pouvaient pas se mettre d’accord sur un plan cohérent global pour vaincre l’épidémie, ni pour distribuer des vaccins. Et même, certaines personnes n’étaient même pas d’accord de porter un masque.</p><p>Mais la perception globale va changer à mesure que le climat va se réchauffer. L’effondrement écologique est une catastrophe à progression lente. On ne la sent d’abord pas, on ne réussit pas à en saisir l’urgence. Car il n’y a pas le feu au lac. Pour l’instant.Mais une fois que nous aurons passé un point de bascule –et nous le saurons de manière très claire quand ça arrivera –quand des conflits liés à la lutte pour des ressources tourneront en guerres véritables, quand la violence occasionnelle se transformera en violence généralisée, et soudain, ce seront <em>vos </em>enfants qui auront faim, et <em>votre </em>maison qui sera balayée et <em>votre </em>pays qui sera en guerre … à ce point, on oubliera les «cela ne marchera jamais» &nbsp;et ce sera «sauve qui peut»</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Gagner la partie planétaire finale</strong></h2><p>A un moment, dans la troisième décennie du 21ème siècle, alors que la Terre enregistrera une augmentation de température de deux ou trois degrés et que nous contemplerons la possibilité d’un effondrement total de notre civilisation, le monde sera prêt pour un tournant monumental.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/610dbbc732f7e69a51eb707a_truecost_manifesto_FRENCH_600x776.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍</p><h2><strong>La Coalition Verte</strong></h2><p>Mettons le COÛT VRAI au programme de tous les partis Verts du monde.

It’s a nut I just can’t crack.</p><p>I don’t get why the stock market goes up when there’s bad news. Or why at a time of climate crisis the Dow Jones is breaking all records. I don’t know why 30 percent of new wealth is speculative — no physical objects bought or sold. Or exactly what work the three trillion dollars sloshing around the global economy every day is actually doing. Nobody has ever been able to explain this to me in a way that makes sense.</p><p>And how come tax havens still exist? And why did no one on Wall Street go to jail after the meltdown of 2008?</p><p>It is all a mystery to me.</p><p>But I think maybe I’ve been looking in the wrong place. Maybe the answer isn’t in The New York Times, The Guardian, the evening news, or the books I’ve been reading.</p><p>My new theory is that a long time ago, capitalism got infected with a virus. And that virus seized control of its host and began to deform it. Capitalism drifted from its origins as an honest exchange between you and me with both of us walking away satisfied. The purity of that exchange got eaten away. Until now, a millennium later, we have . . . whatever the fuck it is we have today. Junk capitalism. Predatory capitalism. Or simply a “death cult,” as Jia Tolentino called it.</p><p>If this really is a doomsday sect then it all starts to make sense, this place we ended up: The dehumanization of personal exchange. The explosive tension between rich and poor. The constant threat of speculative bubbles and ecological tipping points.</p><p>And maybe the virus, the actual virus, the one in the brain of the global economy is . . .</p><p>Money itself.</p><p>This thing that has grown and grown until it casts this immense cultural shadow, eclipsing security and trust and freedom and even love.</p><p>*</p><p>The infection begins the moment we replace gift-giving and straighton barter with some symbolic object: a shell, a coin, a paper note.</p><p>And this early money is a harmless, necessary thing — a placeholder for my chicken and your promise to build me a chicken coop. A portable bit of value that says, “Yes, I’m good for it ...”</p><p>It’s a leap of faith, really. We agree to believe in the value of the things being exchanged. We look each other in the eye and buy in, together.</p><p>And so the virus lives dormant in us. At least at first.</p><p>But the thing about “trust me” is that there are no guarantees. Our best intentions are vulnerable to outside interference. This is what the old myths were about, how we puny humans are powerless when the gods start moving the furniture around.</p><p>And so as more and more distance creeps in, as money becomes more abstract, the virus mutates into ever more deadly strains.</p><p>*</p><p>The writing was on the wall a millennium ago.</p><p>In his marvelous book The Structures of Everyday Life: Civilization and Capitalism 15th–18th Century, historian Fernand Braudel wrote of the gradual insinuation of the money economy into the lives of medieval peasants: “What did it actually bring? Sharp variations in prices of essential foodstuffs; incomprehensible relationships in which man no longer recognized either himself, his customs or his ancient values. His work became a commodity, himself a ‘thing.’”</p><p>Because, see, as soon as there’s money, lo and behold someone shows up whose job it is to . . . handle it. To keep track of our affairs for us. And naturally they need to make a living: just a little off the top.</p><p>So now there’s this third party in the mix, between you and me, between my chicken and your promise to build me a chicken coop: A middle man. He isn’t part of the actual exchange, but he’s taking a cut of our trade.</p><p>And holy hell, that is the job to have. Because unlike our original transaction, there are no limits to it. Making money off of money is a little bit of magic. That guy can get ahead no matter which way the wind blows.</p><p>It’s a sweet deal, because now there’s real wealth to be had — it’s in the currency itself — silver coins, gold ingots, printed notes.</p><p>A purity of intention used to run through the village: We are trading partners; we are partners. We are tight. What can I give you, brother? But now things have changed. You could be ripped off. So you have to protect yourself. You look at your neighbor with a touch of suspicion.</p><p>Human interactions are no longer holy but transactional — every move has become a cost-benefit calculation.</p><p>Alienation creeps in.</p><p>*</p><p>The Catholic Church has a lot to answer for in all this. In 1095, it made a move no one saw coming: it started selling papal indulgences.</p><p>This changed the very nature of money. Money was now this thing so powerful you could buy your way into heaven with it.</p><p>What a great business model for the church. The exploitation of medieval fears of damnation proved so successful that the sale of indulgences became an industry. Usury. Debt and the erasure of debt, a gateway to unfathomable riches.</p><p>*</p><p>Let the colonial pillaging begin!</p><p>When the Spanish conquistadores landed in the Caribbean and put slaves to work extracting gold, some mothers opted to kill their children and themselves rather than die slowly in the mines.</p><p>For those Spanish sailors, looting and killing with a view to earning more and more and more, the drive wasn’t greed so much as shame and desperation. Everyone was caught in a debt trap. Living to pay off high-interest loans — for their supplies and the excursions themselves. They could never get out of the hole. They sold their souls trying.</p><p>Usury was the original sin. Something horrible happened at that moment, in the West, when we started going down that path.</p><p>*</p><p>But this isn’t really a story about money. It’s about the choices we made to allow money to shape us. The moment money started using us, rather than the other way around.</p><p>So when was the tipping point? When did money stop being a tool and become . . . a wish?</p><p>Was it in the Middle Ages, when the goldsmiths who were storing money for folks in their vaults realized they could crib a bit and issue receipts for money they didn’t actually have in the vaults? That was the moment that deceit got baked into the banking system.</p><p>Or was it in 1971, when President Nixon abandoned the gold standard — unhitching global currency from any real value at all?</p><p>Or was it 2008, when, as the banking crisis threatened to hobble the world economy, the world’s industrial nations brought three trillion dollars of toxic debt from private financial institutions?</p><p>At what point did it become clear that money is simply a fiction? And that those in charge of the storytelling hold the power in a culture?</p><p>In truth there was no single moment that money became the lifeblood of our civilization, any more than there is a single identifiable moment when a virus starts making you sick.</p><p>*</p><p>And so here we are, in the endgame of financialized speculation, of digital hyper-abstraction.</p><p>This is the most toxic strain of the virus.</p><p>Complicated bets made with borrowed money by people who don’t know what they’re doing. Financial assets like derivatives and credit-default swaps — the same instruments that stole the show in the 2008 meltdown and cast such a long economic shadow now — bundled together and hawked as the world’s best way to get rich. Speculations on speculations, hedges on hedges . . . these trillions coursing through the circulatory system of the world, this isn’t real money, or even the idea of money. It is the idea of the idea of the idea of money. A conceptual hallucination.</p><p>Money has transcended reality. Its circulation has become an end in itself. The value of over-the-counter derivatives contracts now dwarfs the entire world’s GDP. A fundamental shift in the nature of value has taken place right before our eyes.</p><p>*</p><p>It didn’t have to be like this.</p><p>What if we could walk this story back, as far as it takes, and then change some key decisions, so that a new story unfolds?</p><p>Maybe the rewrite begins in 1095, the moment the Catholic Church brought usury into the economic system.</p><p>What if Christianity never goes down that road? Instead of caving to the demands of kings and rich patrons, it holds fast to moral principle. It prohibits the hoarding of treasure on the backs of others. With that moral weight against it, usury never becomes the bedrock of global finance.</p><p>And another world emerges.</p><p>What else would look different now? Would we have derivatives? Flash trading? Predatory loans? What would our stock markets look like? Would money still be pegged to something of real value, like gold?</p><p>And maybe we never build a gig economy where honor doesn’t even make sense anymore?</p><p>And maybe cryptocurrency becomes a savior meme instead of another speculative sea anchor dragging down the economy. (Bitcoin is the story of what capitalism did to a good idea.)</p><p>Maybe in this alternate universe our Western economic system retains a bit of the pure exchange ethic, worth for worth, the dignity and humanity of the exchangers intact.</p><p>And maybe instead of a functional system gummed up at every turn by the friction of intermediaries taking their pound of flesh — the friction that Western capitalism said you absolutely need for growth and wealth — we instead create a virtually frictionless money system.</p><p>Something a bit like the Islamic economic system.</p><p>Because Islam never went the usury route.</p><p>The class warfare we’re seeing now, this raging hatred that threatens to bring our whole Western house of cards crashing down: the blood of usury is on our hands. The war between rich and poor is the war between creditors and debtors.</p><p>Islam never took that bait. Islam said: We can’t allow the rich to become richer just because they have money in their pocket.</p><p>The point is we had a choice. We still do.</p><p>The only way forward is to flatten the money curve until the virus slowly dies.</p><p>We flatten the money curve and start building toward frictionless money flows.</p><p>We turn money into a public good like the freeways. You can drive from New York to San Francisco without paying any tolls along the way. So why can’t you send $100 to your mother in Lebanon without someone lopping $5 off the top?</p><p>Cutting the middlemen completely out of the equation: that will be our salvation.</p>",,,<p>— from the upcoming Adbusters book</p>,I’ve never quite understood finance.

So our brains slash production, not just back to baseline levels but &nbsp;to well below them. Which sets up a feedback loop: craving and gorging, repeat. “Which makes us all more depressed, more irritable,” Lembke said, “and less able to take joy from the things that used to give us joy — the things that have given people joy for generations.” <em id="""">Even the smallest deprivations now hurt like hell. </em></p><p id="""">The mismatch between the world we were designed for and the pigpen we built for ourselves means every one of us fights private battles every day.

Exhibit one: voluntary caloric restriction — the only proven way to extend the human lifespan. Exhibit two: Icelanders — who are among the longest-lived people on the planet. “This fucking wet rock in the North Atlantic has been punishing us relentlessly for the last eleven hundred years,” said a Harvard neurologist who returned to his native Iceland to study the genetics of his people.

So peace can only come not from piling on more crap but by paring it away. And curating our existing crap. It’s really not about going without; it’s about learning to derive value from things differently — in a way that elevates you by freeing you from clutter and chaos.

Why do you prefer to communicate through texting instead of face-to-face? The number one answer was: so that they can control the message. So there can be no misunderstandings, no mistakes, no embarrassing social fails — no blushing, no hardons, no spinach in the teeth. </p><p id="""">In other words: we prefer connecting online because it’s easier. It’s easier to drink through a straw than to take a fire hose in the face. And that’s what life feels like, a lot of the time: taking a fire hose in the face. Who wouldn’t want to avoid that? </p><p id="""">This is where all our high-tech tools step in to help: they help us avoid the rough stuff. They make life easier. They reduce friction. They create shortcuts. Don’t blame the tools: that’s their job. We created them to do exactly that: to smooth the bumps. And while it’s true that some smoothing is appreciated — we wouldn’t want a world with no wheels, no levers, no computers, no anesthetic — what’s forgotten is what we gave up in the bargain. We got nudged down the path of least resistance. Tech trains us to prefer the easy thing. To take shortcuts and speak in cliches and respond to what the disabled activist Chloe Cooper Jones calls “easy beauty.” </p><p id=""""><em id="""">So we prefer to live online.

The psychologist Ellen Langer calls paying attention this way simply being “mindful.” Mindfulness is the new asceticism. The reward is in being surprised by what was there all along, right under our noses, like an unclaimed lottery ticket. We don’t need to extract more. There is plenty here already. </p><p id="""">This becomes the new definition of wealth. The old definition was sitting on a chunk of money that grows faster than average income —so by doing nothing you’re pulling farther and farther ahead of the folks who have no wealth and are working their butts off. We now know there are hidden costs in living like that. They’re etched in the faces of Anna Lembke’s clients in her psychiatrist’s office in the Bay Area. You cannot really enjoy what you haven’t rightly earned. The old, unearned wealth beats under the floorboards like Poe’s “telltale heart” even while you sleep. The new wealth is what the economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegan called existence itself: it is a free gift from the sun. </p><p id="""">[AESTHETICO] </p><p id="""">The vibe of the 21st century is ... restraint. </p><p id="""">Anybody buying that? It’s not a very sexy proposition. </p><p id="""">So let’s reframe it. Restraint is different from self-denial. It’s closer to a kind of realignment of your desires to your values and your genuine needs. </p><p id="""">The new asceticism is not a bald plea for anti- materialistic minimalism. It's not a Biblical injunction to stop coveting things. It’s an invitation to prioritize different kinds of things: things that aren’t strictly practical. They may not have much resale value. They are personal, and that is their currency. They modulate your mood and mindset and sense of purpose. They’re the things you’d rescue first if your house was on fire. </p><p id="""">Through the pandemic, a new vibe emerged around employment. People all around the world started just saying ... fuck it. An existential scare will do that to you. The prospect of a shorter life brings your priorities into sharp belief.</p><p id="""">Suddenly your donkey-work job just doesn’t seem worth the monumental sacrifice of your time. So people opted out. </p><p id="""">But here’s what’s sometimes misunderstood: all those people who were and still are “lying flat” and “quietly quitting” aren’t lazy. These are protest movements. They’re a vote against dysfunctional systems and carceral labor practices. Few people object to working hard on their own terms at something they find meaningful. In fact, giving an honest day’s labor doing something you and other people value is one &nbsp;of life’s greatest sources of satisfaction.</p><p id="""">What sucks is being denied that opportunity — by a capitalist shell-game that nudges too many folks to do shit jobs under inhumane conditions. That is what’s massively demotivating. Every bit as demotivating as the other extreme — getting something for nothing. (That dopamine firehose.) Being challenged rocks. Being exploited doesn’t. The difference is agency. And agency is the very spine of the new asceticism. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/678ed1179c5a053ca4dcfd79_659752413b6a7ed29e384fda_Screen%2520Shot%25202024-01-04%2520at%25204.48.07%2520PM.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt="""" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">The vibe coming up behind “opting out” will be “opting in.” Leaning in to projects that pluck the strings of your own values, not somebody else’s agenda. “It isn’t work when you enjoy it,” said a friend who seems to be perpetually fixing something or building something or cultivating something — often pretty strenuously and in conditions that look (to me) pretty uncomfortable. The trick comes in resisting the siren tug of the immediate indulgence, whose payoff is so often a devil’s deal. </p><p id="""">[POLITICO] </p><p id="""">The new asceticism is beyond Left and Right </p><p id="""">Left and Right are abstractions. They have some value in helping us organize our ideas and our beliefs, in sorting out how we feel about this or that issue, but they do a disservice to the human beings we’ve labeled “progressive” or “conservative.” Human beings are not abstractions. They are the guy across the Thanksgiving Table with a bit of brussel sprout in his mustache. His politics are not yours, but his basic existential yearnings are. “True community,” said Tish Harrison Warren in her farewell column for The New York Times, “is made up of real people ... of friends with true faults ... of the local, the small. The places we ... become human are not primarily in debates about culture wars or the role of religion in society.” They are holding the baby so a mom can fish out her wallet at the grocery till. They are saying gesundheit to a stranger when she sneezes. They are the impossibly tiny accommodations we make for each other, and it’s an insult to our humanity to lay political abstractions over these things. </p><p id="""">Anna Lembke, the Stanford psychiatrist, has watched her book Dopamine Nation take off as everybody has their own oh-shit moment with it, that mirror held up to karmic arithmetic of their own piggish excesses. She’s been invited to speak on both NPR and on Fox. The message soars above political divisions and speaks to something universal in the human animal. </p><p id="""">Lembke reminds that substances and behaviors we become addicted to have the consequence of driving us into isolation. Essentially, the drug has come to replace the thing that we really want (but fear we can’t have): love and belonging. And those are things nobody owns, or ever can. </p><p id="""">* </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Licking honey off a razor </em></p><p id="""">Maybe, as part of the vibe of the new asceticism, we’ll start to consider the spiritual dimension of the damage that habitual indulgence and lack of self-control does to — let’s just say it — our souls. </p><p id="""">Addictive behavior, the Tibetan Buddhists say, is like “licking honey off a razor” — sweet, but you pay for it. </p><p id="""">Buddhism resonates with the new aestheticism; it trains us to still our monkey minds, put a name to our unproductive cravings and let them go.

But unless your head is buried in the sand, it’s not possible to be ignorant of the extraordinary planetary crisis that confronts all of us today. Environmental collapse no longer merely threatens: we are well into it and it’s already apparent that civilization as we know it is going to be transformed in some very uncomfortable ways by the mutually-reinforcing breakdown of ecological systems, especially global climate change, ozone depletion, rapid disappearance of many species, and various types of pollution, including some we don’t know about yet.</p><p id="""">Although our globalizing economic system is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the biosphere, the ceos who direct this system (as much as anyone controls it) can’t plan much further than the next quarterly report, anymore than politicians can think further than the next election. Overpopulation, pandemics, and the increasing deprivation of basic necessities for vast numbers of people threaten social breakdown, while the media – profit-making enterprises whose primary focus is the bottom-line, rather than investigating and revealing the truth – distract us with infotainment and assurances that the solution is “more of the same”: keep the faith, hang in there long enough and eventually technological development and economic growth, more consumerism and greater GNP will resolve our problems.</p><p id="""">As if that were not enough, our ignorant, corrupt and arrogant leaders, or rather rulers, have shown themselves to be inept at everything except lying and gaining power. Now that their deceit and incompetence are coming back to haunt them, their popularity has been plummeting – but at the same time they have been consolidating their power. The faces will change, while the power structure remains much the same, unless we find ways to do something about it.</p><p id="""">One of the most important tools for maintaining their power is fear, which requires replacing the Cold War with a never-ending “war on terror” that means never-ending profits for a military-industrial complex that fattens on war and would collapse without it. Intentionally or not, the war on terror has been prosecuted in a way guaranteed to produce a dozen more despairing people who hate the US for every “terrorist” we kill. Our aggressive efforts to suppress terrorism ensure that it will continue. As Peter Ustinov put it, terrorism is the war of the poor; war is the terrorism of the rich. The violence of small terrorist groups such as al Qaeda is, in the final analysis, trivial compared to the “state terrorism” (including sanctioned torture) that we feel justified in unleashing on anyone else who scares us or challenges our “national interests.”</p><p id="""">I do not offer the above reflections as political opinion (“c’mon, we have to hear the other side too!”) but as fact. It is the critical situation we find ourselves in today, and we need to face up to it quickly. To be quite blunt, if you are not at least dimly aware of these urgent problems, then you are living in some very strange bubble devoid of news. Either you are not paying attention, or something is wrong with your ability to see. There is a special place in hell reserved for those who refuse to give up the self-centered indifference that allows them to rest indefinitely on their cushions while the rest of the world goes to hell.</p><p id="""">I approach this from the perspective of a Buddhist. Buddhism encourages mindfulness and awareness, and it’s especially necessary today for that awareness to extend beyond our sitting cushions and dharma practice halls, to embrace a broader understanding of what is happening in our world, to our world – a world that cries out in pain. Like Kwan Yin, the enlightened archetype of compassion, we need to be able to hear that pain.</p><p id="""">Sometimes, we think that Buddhist meditation practice means “just seeing, just hearing” (just feeling is good! – concepts are bad). There are times and places in which we need to focus on immediate sensory and mental phenomena, yet such practices are by themselves incomplete, like a Buddhist awakening that liberates us without also motivating us to address the liberation of those around us. Otherwise, we may end up like the proverbial frogs at the bottom of a deep well, oblivious to the wider world that exists outside. If your spiritual practice makes you allergic to all concepts and abstractions, then you’d better be prepared to visit the South Pole to experience directly your own ozone-hole sunburn. And the Arctic tundra, to wallow personally in the melting permafrost mud. And the slums of Bogota and Rio de Janeiro, to see for yourself how families try to survive there. And Baghdad, to learn for yourself what “bringing democracy to the Middle East” means on the ground . . . and a lot of other places as well, to become aware of what is happening in the world right now.</p><p id="""">Those of us who do not have the time, money or energy for such travel need to develop wider awareness in other ways, ways which do not rely on junk media or the Bush spin machine. We must employ our critical faculties to understand the enormous challenges facing the world we live in. Concepts and generalizations are not bad in themselves. Rejecting them is like blaming the victim, for the problem is in the way we misuse them.</p><p id="""">Believing that “mindfulness” means attentiveness only to one’s immediate surroundings and placing such limits on our awareness is really another version of the basic problem, which is our sense of separation from each other and from the world we are “in.” Anatta (non-self) means that it is delusive to distinguish “one’s own best interests” from what is in the best interest of everyone. The world is not that kind of zero-sum game. That is why karma works the way it does. There are two other common Buddhist responses to this argument, which try to justify focusing solely on one’s own practice and enlightenment. The first is that we must tend to our own liberation before we can be of service to others; the second is that, because there are no sentient beings from the highest point of view – everything is ‘empty’ – we needn’t worry about their fate, nor that of the biosphere. Neither of these answers will do, however, because in different ways, they are both dualistic half-truths at best.</p><p id="""">To begin with, we can’t wait until we have overcome all our own suffering before addressing that of others because the world is speeding up, and events are not going to wait for you and me to attain great enlightenment. Since the degrees of enlightenment are infinite (even the Buddha is only halfway there, according to a Zen saying), we need to contribute whatever we can here and now. More precisely, we need to do what we can, according to where we are in our practice right now.</p><p id="""">Furthermore, that objection misunderstands how spiritual practice works. We don’t wait until we overcome our self-centeredness before engaging with the world; addressing the suffering of the wider world is how we overcome our self-centeredness. Contrary to common belief, bodhisattvas (spiritually developed beings) do not defer their own perfect enlightenment in order to help others. Rather, helping others is how they perfect their enlightenment, because they know that their own liberation ultimately cannot be distinguished from the liberation of others. We awaken from our own suffering to discover ourselves in a world full of suffering. To awaken is to realize that you are none other than that world.</p><p id="""">But it’s all empty, right? Yes and no. To focus solely on the emptiness aspect is to dualize again and misunderstand the essential teaching of Mahayana (greater vehicle) Buddhism. Form is emptiness, but emptiness is also form. Phenomena have no essence, yet our formless essential nature manifests in one form or another; without manifestations it remains nothing, amounts to nothing, has no meaning. Not to cherish the intricate web of life that the Earth has miraculously spun – which includes us, deluded as we are – is to denigrate the wondrous activity of the essential nature that we share with all other beings. Enlightenment is not about attaining some higher reality or transcendental dimension, but about realizing our essential oneness with the world, which is the same as realizing the emptiness of our self-being and acting accordingly. Without a healthy biosphere, the possible forms available to emptiness are much diminished. Without healthy societies, the possibilities for fulfilling human activity, including following the path to enlightenment, are damaged.</p><p id="""">What would the Buddha do? How would he respond to our situation? </p><p id="""">I sometimes wonder what he would think about Buddhism today. The Buddha never taught Buddhism; we can even say that he was not a Buddhist, just as Jesus was never a Christian. Shakyamuni Buddha taught the Dhamma (natural law). Buddhism isn’t what the Buddha taught, it’s what the Buddha began. Buddhism as we know it is how the Dhamma and Sangha (spiritual assembly) developed over the centuries, in many different places and cultures. Would he be pleased with what his efforts begat?</p><p id="""">The Buddha’s teachings emphasize impermanence and insubstantiality. He wouldn’t be surprised by the history of constant change, or by the extraordinary adaptability that Buddhism has demonstrated wherever it has spread. He wouldn’t expect us to simply follow and repeat his ways of teaching, nor to cling to the rules that evolved for regulating the Sangha in his day. Surely he would not want us to remain unaware of the challenges that face us collectively, nor would he expect his followers to ignore them. In his time, the Sangha could largely ignore political struggles and social conflict by retreating back into the forest; today there is nowhere on Earth to hide that is not under some threat. The traditional duality between lay and ordained does not apply in this situation. Our fates cannot be distinguished.</p><p id="""">What would the Buddha do? Is the answer that we can’t know, because he’s not here? If the Buddha doesn’t live in us and as us, he is indeed dead. If those of us who are Buddhists are unable to answer that question for ourselves, Buddhism is dead. Or might as well be. The challenge is for people like you and me to apply the most important Buddhist teachings to our present situation. If those teachings do not work for understanding and addressing the global crises we face today, so much the worse for those teachings – maybe it’s time to get rid of them.</p><p id="""">But I do not think that is what is called for. The most distinctive Buddhist teaching is also the one that gives us the most insight into the collective crises confronting us: the relationship between dukkha and anatta – in other words, the connection between suffering (in the broadest sense) and the delusive sense of self. A sense of self is inevitably uncomfortable since, being a psychological construct, it is groundless, and the usual ways in which it tries to ground itself to feel more “real” just make things worse. This essential truth about the individual self is just as revealing about “collective selves,” which also try to secure themselves by promoting their own group self-interest at the price of those outside. This gets to the heart of why sexism, racism, nationalism, militarism and speciesism (the alienation between human beings and the rest of the biosphere) are self-defeating: if our sense of separation is the problem, embracing our interdependence must be at the heart of any solution. Our rulers are failing so miserably because their policies embody and reinforce the delusion of separation, which is why they keep aggravating the world’s dukkha (suffering) rather than alleviating it.</p><p id="""">Such interdependence is not merely a realization to be cultivated on our cushions. A suffering world calls upon us to realize interdependence – to make it real – in the ways we actually live. This includes finding ways to confront institutionalized greed (our present economic system), institutionalized ill will (our militarism and punitive justice systems) and institutionalized delusion (the propaganda and advertising systems maintained by the media). It will not be easy to work out the best ways to challenge and transform these institutionalized evils. But Buddhist principles – whatever your background – provide important guides to doing so.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/62a901bc649ecf0138d34f0b_what_would_buddha_do_600px.jpg,,<p><em>David Loy is Besl Professor of ethics/religion and society at Xavier University.

Even before the proceedings began, it was clear that the world’s wealthiest countries had <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-developed-countries-to-miss-goal-of-100-billion-climate-aid-pledged-to/"">fallen well short</a> of coming up with the $100 billion they had agreed a decade ago to give the poorest, so that the latter might have a shot at staving off the worst of the gathering swelter — plainly, undeserved punishment <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56941979"">doled out by the former</a>. Incidentally or not, at over five hundred strong, the fossil-fuel lobby <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/world/cop26-climate-fossil-fuel-lobbying-intl/index.html"">outnumbered</a> any one country’s delegation to the Scottish summit. In the words of John Kerry, it was environmental diplomacy’s “<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55835266"">last best chance,</a>” seemingly squandered. </p><p>It gets worse. According to a <a href=""https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/997/CAT_2021-11-09_Briefing_Global-Update_Glasgow2030CredibilityGap.pdf"">report by Climate Action Tracker</a>, the net-zero consensus formed in the lead-up to COP26 is <a href=""https://www.ccag.earth/newsroom/net-zero-by-2050-is-too-little-too-late-world-leading-scientists-urge-global-leaders-to-focus-on-net-negative-strategies"">hugely inadequate</a>, putting the rise in global temperatures on track to handily surpass the <a href=""https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-change-conference-november-2015/paris-agreement"">Paris Agreement</a>’s hard upper limit of two degrees Celsius by century’s end. That’s assuming, however, that national governments make good on their pledges. If you read the fine print, you’ll find that in order to offset the roughly <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions"">140 million tons of greenhouse gases</a> spewed into the atmosphere tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, they count on the feasibility of large-scale carbon-capture technologies. The problem is, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/climate-scientists-concept-of-net-zero-is-a-dangerous-trap-157368"">those don’t yet exist</a>. All the same, governments and corporations the world over have cited the mere wish for these quick-fix gimmicks to justify an approach to “net zero” that essentially amounts to “burn now, remediate later.” (Even Amazon has gotten on board, having made its vow to <a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/we-are-all-in-on-the-climate-pledge-net-zero-carbon-by-2040"">go carbon-neutral by 2040</a> in the first year of Covid-19 — the same year its annual emissions <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/amazon-says-carbon-emissions-rose-19percent-in-2020.html"">rose nearly 20 percent</a>.) To trot out an already <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/13/cop26-reactions-rich-nations-have-kicked-the-can-down-the-road"">much</a>-<a href=""https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/cop26-rich-nations-kick-can-down-road"">used</a> phrase, it’s all just a kick of the can down the road to dusty death. <strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Original Spin </strong>‍</p><p>Between the urgency of the crisis and COP’s unreadiness to act, faith in the process now demands either profound gullibility or plain ignorance. Yet was there ever any good reason to believe? In truth, signs of trouble could be seen from the start. For one, the bureaucratic nature of the UNFCCC (as with any intergovernmental body) was bound from the beginning to make change slow-going to the point of tedium. But if time ever seemed in decent supply, today the bottom of the well has been all but reached. For another, the interests of the fossil-fuel industry “remain stitched into global networks of power directly descended from the age of imperialism,” as <a href=""https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism"">Adam Tooze puts it</a>. The force of the industry’s presence in Glasgow, and the nearly <a href=""https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/09/23/Still-Not-Getting-Energy-Prices-Right-A-Global-and-Country-Update-of-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-466004"">seven percent of global GDP</a> ($5.9 trillion) it received last year in subsidies, are stark reminders of its unyielding supremacy. <br></p><p>Last, for all their self-congratulatory fanfare and high-minded rhetoric, the COP summits have never amounted to much more than just that: fanfare and rhetoric. Mostly, they have served as neat opportunities for governments to launder their environmentalist credibility and affirm their geopolitical standing while doing nothing to address the perilous economic incentives underlying the crisis. In this deluded paradigm, talk is as good as action, the fossil-fuel industry is a tameable beast, and the stock of “next years” is inexhaustible. At its core lurk the fatal logic of capitulation and the deadly promise of doomsday. </p><p>So, exactly what, if anything, has COP accomplished? Its signal achievements are the <a href=""https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol"">Kyoto Protocol</a> (adopted at COP3) and the <a href=""https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement"">Paris Agreement</a> (adopted at COP21). The second’s existence suggests the failure of the first. The US refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the Senate having unanimously <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/senate-resolution/98"">resolved</a> to reject any climate treaty that would either mandate emissions-reduction commitments for “developed” countries but not for “developing” ones, or do “serious harm” to the American economy. When it formally withdrew its signature, in 2001, the US was <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region?tab=table&time=earliest..2005"">the world’s top emitter</a>. As developing countries, China and India (then the world’s number-two and number-five emitters, respectively) were exempt from the Protocol’s <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/26/world/kyoto-protocol-fast-facts/index.html"">binding targets</a> to reduce annual emissions to five percent below what they were in 1990 — targets to be reached in the four short years between 2008 and 2012. When the time came to <a href=""https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/the-doha-amendment"">reaffirm the treaty</a>, many developed countries didn’t take on new targets, while Canada (then a <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region?tab=table&time=earliest..2012"">top-ten emitter</a>) <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-pulls-out-of-kyoto-protocol-1.999072"">dropped out altogether</a>. By 2012, emissions worldwide had <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region?tab=table&time=1990..2012"">gone up by almost 55 percent</a> relative to 1990. The need for a new and truly global charter was then not only plain but paramount. </p><p>Coming into force four years later, the Paris Agreement effectively supplanted Kyoto and is the reigning climate treaty to this day. Its nearly 200 parties have sworn to undertake “ambitious efforts” to fulfil their “nationally determined contributions,” which (unlike Kyoto) are non-binding targets self-determined by each participating country. Yet even if all signatories were to live up to their current NDCs, which most are failing to do, <a href=""https://unfccc.int/news/climate-commitments-not-on-track-to-meet-paris-agreement-goals-as-ndc-synthesis-report-is-published"">they still wouldn’t go nearly far enough</a> to hold the increase in temperature “well below” two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — one of the Agreement’s signature goals, designed to “significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change” or, in plain terms, avoid the total collapse of civilization. At this point, seeing that goal through would require a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/26/un-climate-emissions/"">herculean curtailing</a> of emissions: a cutback of 45 percent (relative to 2010) by 2030. Now, halfway towards that due date, emissions have gone <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region?tab=table&time=2010..latest"">not down but up</a>, by four percent. As things stand, we are poised to see the mercury climb nearly <a href=""https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/"">three degrees by the end of this century</a> (or just over two degrees if, against all odds, all the shirkers and truants together <a href=""https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/paris-global-climate-change-agreements"">go far above and well beyond the status quo</a>). Whatever the Paris Agreement has achieved thus far, it has been neither to keep fossil fuels below ground nor to forestall the mounting heat, to say nothing of spreading the misery fairly. It certainly hasn’t compelled the carbon-tipped-pencil pushers to stick to their word. </p><p><strong>The Fire Next Time </strong></p><p>If hope no longer dwells within the building, might it linger, seething, just outside the doors? With COP26’s deliberations underway, <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-59185007"">one hundred thousand people marched</a> in the streets of Glasgow in the name of climate justice. “The message is that the system of COPs … isn’t working. So we need to uproot that system,” a young activist affiliated with Fridays for Future <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-59165781"">told the BBC</a>. “The message is you need to listen to the people in the streets, the young people, the workers.” Needless to say, despite their numbers and their earnestness, those in the streets were decidedly not heeded by those <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-59128875"">nodding off</a> in the conference hall. Stand by for the uprooting of the system. </p><p>Indeed, in a quarter-century of summits, COP has done a stellar job of ignoring the pleas of demonstrators. Milling among fellow activists playing dead in the middle of a thoroughfare, “protesters in UN delegate costumes carried signs saying ‘Blah-Blah-Blah’ and did nothing,” recalls a certain Swede. “On signal, we marched to the [conference venue] and tried to prevent the delegates from leaving by locking ourselves to the gates … all the while chanting: ‘No more blah-blah-blah … Action now!’” This had nothing to do with Extinction Rebellion (XR). It had nothing to do with Fridays for Future, or with Greta Thunberg either. In fact, Greta wasn’t there, or anywhere: she hadn’t been born yet. “This happened in 1995. The scene was COP1,” writes activist and scholar Andreas Malm. “The delegates snuck out through a backdoor … In the twenty-five years after [they] left, more carbon was released from underground stocks than in the seventy-five years before they met.” </p><p>Malm has travelled the civil-disobedience path further than most (not least alongside German coal-mine occupiers <a href=""https://www.ende-gelaende.org/en/"">Ende Gelände</a>). “We march, we block, we stage theatres, we hand over lists of demands to ministers, we chain ourselves, we march the next day too.” Over the years, the crowds have grown bigger and bigger, and the rhetoric has become more desperate: “we talk of extinction and no future.” All the same, “business continues very much as usual.” How long can this go on for? When, if ever, will environmentalists consider other means, other strategies to achieve their aims? How high do the flames have to get before we reach for the axe on the wall? In brief, “At what point do we escalate?” </p><p>This question is at the heart of Malm’s rigorous and seriously considered book, <em>How to Blow Up a Pipeline</em>. To be clear, it isn’t an instruction manual, nor is it a reckless provocation. It’s a carefully reasoned, historically informed, and principled case for forms of resistance beyond non-violence, in the face of an immovable fossil-fuel hegemony. In Malm’s eyes, it’s only when all peaceable means (appeals to reason, dialogue, demonstrations) have been exhausted that the first tentative step in the direction of escalation is justified. Consider the futility of thirty years’ worth of intergovernmental summits and always-accompanying protests. Might the time to up the ante have come already? “To say that the signals have fallen on the deaf ears of the ruling classes of this world” — those who have the money, the political might, and the law at their backs — “would be an understatement,” Malm declares. (In his <a href=""https://www.versobooks.com/books/2002-fossil-capital"">other writing</a>, he has argued that fossil fuels are so deeply imbedded in the logic of capitalism as to be inextricable.) “After the past three decades, there can be no doubt that [they] are constitutionally incapable of responding to the catastrophe in any other way than by expediting it.” The better question is, given the urgency and the scale of the present crisis, “Is there a good reason we have waited this long?” </p><p>What’s most striking in all this, as Malm points out, isn’t even so much that he takes this radical tack. After providing a brief history of politically motivated pipeline vandalism, he puzzles as to “<em>why these things don’t happen </em>— or rather, why they happen for all sorts of reasons good and bad, but not for the climate.” It isn’t a matter of technical difficulty. As <em>Pipeline and Gas Journal </em><a href=""http://www.iags.org/n0328051.htm"">conceded in 2005</a>, amid hard-bitten resistance to the US-led occupation of Iraq, the titular infrastructure is “very easily sabotaged. A simple explosive device can put a critical section … out of operation for weeks.” Rather, the remarkable rarity of this kind of action is explained by “the general demise of revolutionary politics,” no thanks to neoliberalism’s dissent-stifling triumph, and “insufficient politicisation of the climate crisis.” In other words, though many might agonise over humanity’s impending doom, “they rarely see a means for fighting back.” </p><p><strong>Resistance Is Futile </strong></p><p>In Malm’s account, this state of anguished resignation is largely due to a self-imposed limitation on tactics. While the stakes have steadily risen, a quasi-theological commitment to non-violence has only taken faster hold of the climate movement. He distinguishes between this tenet’s two major strains. Moral pacifism (à la Bill McKibben) “says that it is always wrong to commit acts of violence,” whereas strategic pacifism contends that, whether right or wrong, “violence committed by social movements always takes them further from their goal.” Belief in the efficacy of strategic pacifism is closely clung to by creeds such as XR, <a href=""https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/314/314671/this-is-not-a-drill/9780141991443.html"">which claims</a> that absolute peacefulness has shown itself historically to be the only admissible route to social transformation. Violence, on the other hand, “almost always leads to fascism and authoritarianism.” From the suffragettes to Gandhi, the civil-rights movement to Nelson Mandela, the non-violent “civil resistance model” has proved not only morally but tactically superior to any other means — violent confrontation above all. </p><p>So the story goes. But does it stand up to scrutiny? As Malm takes some pains to show, it would be a mistake to read such strict pacifism into these struggles. The suffragettes? “Their tactic of choice was property destruction.” Indian independence? “Subaltern violence marked the route to India, from the mutiny of 1857 to that of 1946.” The civil-rights movement? “Herbert H. Haines <a href=""https://utpress.org/title/black-radicals-and-the-civil-rights-mainstream/"">recaps the dialectic</a>: ‘Nonviolent direct action struck at the heart of powerful political interests because it could so easily turn to violence.’” Nelson Mandela? “Sabotage remained the main modus operandi” of anti-apartheid militants but, by Mandela’s own <a href=""https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/nelson-mandela/long-walk-to-freedom/9780759521049/"">account</a>, “if sabotage did not produce the results we wanted, we were prepared to move on to the next stage: guerrilla warfare and terrorism.” </p><p>The point here isn’t to suggest that non-violence is impotent, that violence is glorious, or that violence alone can solve the problems of our time. (Malm is quick to assert that “non-violent mass mobilisation should … be the first resort, militant action the last” and keen to celebrate all that has been done without taking up arms.) Instead, it’s to ask “whether it is possible to locate <em>even one minimally relevant analogue to the climate struggle that has not contained some violence</em>.” If not, then the historical basis for the doctrine of strategic pacifism, long and inflexibly upheld, must be put into question. As to the climate, how far has it gotten us until now? In the struggle to reel our species back from the brink of annihilation, how much more time can we afford to waste in niggling over what Malm sees as false niceties? </p><p><strong>Steady Loving Hands </strong></p><p>The answer, of course, is less than none. So, what’s to be done? This is the smouldering question facing today’s climate existentialists. Malm’s answer is to “announce and enforce the prohibition” of CO2-emitting devices. “Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up.” Send the message to investors that henceforth the filthy flow of profits will cease, to the rich and profligate that their luxuriating at the cost of a liveable future will no longer be suffered. “Property destruction,” however, “doesn’t have to come in the form of explosions, projectiles, pyromania.” Note that hurting people doesn’t come into it either, let alone the bogeyman known as terrorism (credibly defined as “<em>the deliberately indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians for the purpose of instilling terror</em>”). The word of the day is “sabotage,” and it “can be done softly, even gingerly.” </p><p>What’s less clear is what it would do to the climate movement. Clearly, not everyone is bound to be on board with blowing up pipelines. Malm looks askance at “total tactical conformity” and speculates that support for intensified resistance will only grow as the ecological noose tightens. He admits that “climate militancy would have to be articulated to a wider anti-capitalist groundswell” and acknowledges that a tactical escalation of the kind he proposes risks provoking not only mainstream vilification but a crippling crackdown from on high. (As in the case of <a href=""https://grist.org/protest/dakota-access-pipeline-activists-property-destruction/"">Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya</a>, who, after “exploring and exhausting all avenues of process,” proceeded with “steady loving hands” to tamper with the Dakota Access Pipeline. Pleading guilty, they were indicted on charges carrying a sentence of over a century.) Yet he presupposes that a radical flank within the movement will, more likely than not, be capable of pushing past these obstacles and recalibrating the conversation around a more proactive midpoint. Exactly how this might happen, though, “cannot be known beforehand. It can be found only through immersion in practice.” Adam Tooze <a href=""https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n22/adam-tooze/ecological-leninism"">likens this attitude</a> to “a revolutionary cadre hedging his bets.” It places a lot of faith in the persuasive power of the deed. </p><p>Yet even if militant action were met with censure and repression, even if it became obvious that it had arrived too late to accomplish anything of substance, Malm maintains that it would still hold symbolic, even transcendent, value. He compares this sort of foredoomed defiance to the Jewish resistance to the Nazis. “Beyond the immediate outcome of the struggle, which most often was inevitable, their combat was for history, for memory,” he quotes approvingly from Alain Brossat’s and Sylvie Klingberg’s <a href=""https://www.versobooks.com/books/2520-revolutionary-yiddishland""><em>Revolutionary Yiddishland</em></a>. “<em>This affirmation of life by way of a sacrifice and combat with no prospect of victory </em>is a tragic paradox that can only be understood as an act of faith in history.” As the analogy pertains to the climate crisis, Malm reckons that if “it is too late for resistance to be waged within a calculus of immediate utility, the time has come for it to vindicate the fundamental values of life, even if it only means crying out to the heavens.” As it happens, making “that statement would require some forceful type of action.” It’s not hard to imagine what he has in mind. </p><p>Before we’re left with no option but to go out in a blaze, the chance remains that peaceful protestors might have their way; that the powers that be listen to the kids, get their act together, and make some semblance of good. Undoubtedly, it’s the scenario most would prefer to see happen, even Malm. In light of the catastrophic shortcomings of all-hands efforts like COP26, however, the likelihood that things could actually go down in this manner appears increasingly meagre. Yet there do exist unplumbed ways to proceed that sidestep the perils of succumbing to despair — that is, of giving in to suicidal fatalism. Malm makes a compelling case for one plausible, if pause-giving, approach to breaking up the moral, intellectual, and political deadlock currently seizing the climate struggle. His penetrating analysis alone is nigh-on essential to a clear-eyed understanding of the present dilemma. Can our species save itself by any means short of revolution? That depends — alarmingly and against all precedent — on the willingness of those commanding some of history’s most propulsive forces to dismantle the very conditions that have seen them behind the world’s control panel for the past 150 years. Regardless of whether you find his conclusions palatable, Malm has dared prompt the most pressing question of the hour, the inward challenge everyone must meet at this fateful juncture in the human story.

For an answer squarely in the affirmative, see autonomous zones: pockets of sovereignty where the people, asserting themselves, mount scale-model societies unloosed from the dual bonds of capitalist industry and the industrial state. Radical in spirit and prefigurative in principle, autonomous zones are sociopolitical laboratories in which the shape of a viable future may well be cast. At a time when prospects for that kind of a future appear dimmer every day, grasping the results of these experiments isn’t merely interesting, but imperative: if even one of them can withstand the rising heat, it just might prove our last best hope.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Take the zad. Crawling with biodiversity, it spans some 4,000 acres of woods, pasture, hedgerows, and wetlands — a regional mixture known as <em id="""">bocage </em>— near the township of Notre-Dame-des-Landes, in the west of France. Alongside a handful of hold-out farmers, this expanse is home to dozens of squatters who dwell in handmade cabins, tend communal gardens, mill their own wheat, bake their own bread, brew beer, make cheese, tan hides, publish a paper, run a pirate radio station, keep a library — in brief, who make up a leaderless, self-sustaining cooperative. Having staved off public–private designs to pave over the bocage and build a major airport atop it, today the zad’s residents live entirely free of state interference: not a single gendarme has set foot there since the last attempt at evictions, in 2018. Deemed “a territory lost to the Republic,” for now it remains a haven not just to committed anti-capitalists but to uncounted birds, bugs, and beasts otherwise imperilled by the relentless encroachments of the fossil-fueled economy.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/626c5968e14c396471588291_philippe_graton_600.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">This, in a word, is the <em id="""">zone à défendre</em>, or “zone to defend.” It is also the subject of <a href=""https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745345871/we-are-nature-defending-itself/"" id=""""><em id="""">We Are ‘Nature’ Defending Itself: Entangling Art, Activism and Autonomous Zones</em></a>, a pamphlet by Isabelle Fremeaux and Jay Jordan. In this short book, the authors trace not only the history of the zad but their own quest to shed the trappings of their lives as urban “culture workers,” as they call themselves, and don the mantle of <em id="""">zadistes</em>. Their story begins in London. By the early aughts, “Isa” and “JJ” had grown disenchanted with their commitments to academia and protest art, respectively. Though they each had a hand in headline-making actions such as Reclaim the Streets’ “Carnival Against Capitalism” (which prefigured the WTO protests in Seattle), they “felt a toxic pattern repeating”: “As the adrenaline of those days of rage wore off … [w]e would always return home to an everyday life still besieged by capitalism.” The idea was to discover a more permanent means of rebelling against “the extractivist logic of the capitalist metropolis.” So, in 2012, they packed it in and headed for France.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">At that point, the zad was three years old. In the authors’ telling, it arose out of the decades-long struggle to defend not only non-human nature but the homes and livelihoods of farmers whose lands, in the interest of building the airport, were threatened with expropriation. Since the early ’70s, the implications of the label “deferred development zone” provoked increasingly organized efforts at resistance. (The label in the original French, <em id="""">zone d’aménagement différé</em>, is the source of the reclaimed and détourned acronym “zad.”) But by the new millennium, with growing numbers of farmers caving in and moving away, the bocage risked becoming a depopulated “rural desert” ripe for the paving. In 2009, it was the location of France’s first climate camp, at which a collective of unyielding <em id="""">habitants </em>invited the largely urban campers to stay on and squat; some did, taking up residence in abandoned farmhouses or in fresh-made huts. With that, the zad came into being — both as an experiment in communal living and as a bulwark against the depredations of carbon capital.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">It has proved remarkably tenacious, having survived not one but two large-scale incursions on the part of police. Fremeaux and Jordan witnessed both. The first, in 2012, saw officers march on the zone and demolish over a dozen structures; they were met by some 40,000 pro-zad partisans from across the country. Jordan’s account of the face-off reads like a war diary: “I felt the wind of a rubber bullet whistle past my head … Our ears rang with the sharp crack of stun grenades … Our skin burned from tear gas.” Eventually, the state stood down and withdrew. For a little less than six years afterwards, defenders of the zad’s “canvas of commoning” were left to lick their wounds. </p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Then came the cold winds of January 2018. On live TV, then Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced that, though plans for the airport had been scrapped, the zad would be cleared come springtime, whether voluntarily or not. In April, roughly 2,500 gendarmes — one fifth of the country’s aggregate force — were set loose on the squats, flanked by drones, choppers, and armored personnel carriers. It was apparently the largest such deployment France had seen since the historic unrest of May 68. War had returned. In three days, the cops destroyed 40 dwellings and, by the authors’ count, lobbed no fewer than 11,000 stun grenades and teargas canisters. On the fourth day, the zadistes were given an ultimatum: sign individual leases for allotments to be used exclusively for agriculture, or face further and final discipline. Seven of the 70 existing squats, unwilling to compromise their anti-statist principles, folded immediately. The other 63 were saved with a bit of bureaucratic cunning, by which mutually overlapping plots were registered in the names of groups or collectives rather than those of individuals. At the cost of “normalizing” relations with the French state, the total demise of the zad was warded off. As of the writing of <em id="""">We Are ‘Nature’ </em>three years later, it held on yet. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/626c59a525dfc2dbdba79dab_kevin_faingnaert_600.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">While the pamphlet was being completed, the zad prepared to receive a sizable “delegation” of <a href=""https://nacla.org/news/2019/01/18/spark-hope-ongoing-lessons-zapatista-revolution-25-years"" id="""">Zapatistas</a> — emissaries of another strain of resistance, accounts of whose struggle had long served as fodder for the authors’ imaginations. The Zapatistas belong to the militant political movement known as the <em id="""">Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional </em>(EZLN), or Zapatista National Liberation Army. Since 1994, the movement has sought to fend off the trespasses of the North American neoliberal order — with force when necessary — and declare Indigenous sovereignty in Mexico. It has managed to do so in much of Chiapas, the country’s historically poverty-stricken (read: colonialism-ravaged) southernmost state, where it has established a network of “autonomous municipalities” operating on loosely anarchist principles. Some 350,000 people (largely Maya) call these agrarian enclaves home; they boast a cooperative economy, access to rudimentary healthcare and education (where once sorely lacking), a ban on most forms of extraction, and a participatory style of politics based on direct community involvement. Though tensions with the Mexican state have reportedly slackened since the 2000s, the EZLN has never disarmed. As many a sign makes known, in Zapatista territory, “the people command and the government obeys.”</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">Another rebel zone with which Fremeaux and Jordan show tacit solidarity is the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). (At one point, they recount sending off one of the zad’s own “to fight alongside internationalist comrades defending the autonomous region of Rojava,” as the AANES is otherwise known.) As with the Zapatista municipalities, popular control over the zone was won with blood — and not just anyone’s blood. Though multiethnic in makeup, Rojava was born out of the struggle for Kurdish self-determination. Kurds have long suffered statelessness and persecution in so-called Kurdistan, which straddles the junction of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. As civil war broke out in Syria, militias (including the famously all-female Women’s Protection Units) rallied to the defence of the country’s Kurdish-majority northeastern corner, repelling the advances of the Syrian army, various Islamist groups including ISIS, and later the Turkish army. Amid the conflict, Rojava gained <em id="""">de facto </em>autonomy. Its political character is informed by the “democratic confederalism” of Abdullah Öcalan, jailed founder of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, and is marked by aspirations to democracy, feminism, pluralism, communalism, decentralization, respect for refugees, and climate-consciousness. To its champions, its triumph constitutes nothing less than a revolution.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">In the Global North and in the peripheries, in the heartland of capital as in its extraction-blighted hinterland, autonomous zones — the zad, the Zapatista autonomous municipalities, Rojava, and others — have mounted a stubborn, sometimes violent challenge to the political-economic paradigm now threatening humanity with extinction. They’ve sought to counter competition with cooperation, exploitation with mutual aid, top-down command with direct democracy, despoliation with sustainable stewardship. Above all they have demonstrated, in miniature, the viability of ways of living outside and beyond the status quo, exploding the myth that “there is no alternative.” These radical experiments, in short, reveal a hopeful, hidden trailhead where previously there appeared only a single path heading straight for the abyss. The way may be rocky. Where it may ultimately lead is uncertain. But at this point, the urgency of the present crisis — which foreshadows the natural endpoint of the road we have travelled thus far — impels us to explore. The very alternatives once thought untenable may now prove the only way forward. Now is the hour of treading bravely.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/626c5b0812ae8360a729fb1d_philippe_graton_2_600.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/626c597153457844dc38f4af_immo_klink_600.jpg,,<p>- <strong>Trevor Clarke</strong></p>,"Is it possible — in a world crisscrossed with roads, railways, pipelines, and shipping routes — to carve out a little freedom from the free market?",false,false,true
