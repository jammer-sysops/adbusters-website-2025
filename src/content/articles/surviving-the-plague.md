Ordinary life was suspended during the epidemic. Confraternities, associations that brought laypeople together for charity work and socialising, could no longer hold meetings. Public sermons were forbidden. The cityâ€™s schools were closed. Taverns and inns were shut. Gambling dens and barber shops were closed, ball games forbidden.
