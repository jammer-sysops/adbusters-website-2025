The human race is now a Pachinko ball tumbling through the machine. There is simply no predicting the outcome.

It could well be that the best efforts of scientists and political leaders and activists will come to naught, and humanity will spiral into a new dark age that beggars the imagination.

But it’s equally possible that 11th-hour desperation will galvanize the people of earth into a state of readiness for an unprecedented, life-saving mass action.

A crack may well open in the human psyche. If so, True Cost is ready-made to fill it — an idea so huge, so revolutionary that it’ll tip the balance of world power and steer humanity inexorably toward a sane sustainable future.

This moment has never been more precious. The stakes have never been higher.
