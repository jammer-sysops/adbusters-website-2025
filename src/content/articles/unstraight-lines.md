Hello Adbusters,
Read and am inspired by your magazine over the last decade.
Want to comment on your aesthetic war against the straight line.
I was at my job and a client who came from Japan stopped me when I underlined some information with a marker. Startled, I inquired what was at issue. She said how did you learn to draw that line so quickly and clearly.
