You are a proud and deep-rooted people. So why are you acting like serfs? Why are you allowing yourselves to be played like pawns in an autocrat’s game?

You have too much dignity to accept the conditions of this life: Media that lies. Laws so Orwellian no one is allowed to put a name to the raping and killing of civilians. A war so barbaric Russia may never be forgiven.

To sit back and watch your leader, a broken little man, act out some twisted private psychodrama — or worse, to join him in his folly — is to dishonor your own past. It is to spit in the face of every poet and worker and activist who ever fought for the ideals you are now letting Putin blow up.

Let him tremble before your revolution.
