GEN Z — Will You Stop Eating Animals?

Animal flesh is an environmentally disastrous source of protein. And factory farming is responsible for more suffering than anything else we humans do.

And yet we keep wolfing Big Macs, hot dogs and filet mignons with unmitigated abandon.

Only you seem to get it.

Pissed off and armed with the truth, you could be the first generation in human history that goes meatless — and takes the rest of us along for the ride.

A Big Mac (without fries or drink) sells for five or six bucks. But much of the meat that finds its way into a McDonald’s burger is subsidized. The true cost of a Big Mac is actually closer to twelve bucks.

#TwelveBuckBurger has a nice ring to it.

Let’s see who has the appetite to pay full price!
