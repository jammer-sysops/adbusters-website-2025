You are the outsider who smells the stink because you’re new to the room. And who calls “For shame!” at all our indefensible shenanigans — from factory farming to old-growth logging to jailing folks for substance abuse. And oh yeah: letting corporations get away with murder.

You’re the first generation to have the stones to walk out of your classes in protest . . . thereby showing everyone who thinks they’re powerless that, actually, you don’t know your own strength.

You will call bullshit on the stupid metrics we’re chasing and the arbitrary categories we’ve slammed down. You’ll remind us that there is just one race — the human race.

You will write a new story of The American Dream: one that’s not about acquisition and power but about care. One that’s not about riches for me, but a rich life for all of us.

You will teach us to tell the truth beautifully.
