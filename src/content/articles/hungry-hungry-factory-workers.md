![Image](/images/articles/hungry-factory-workers-600x995.jpg)I think of Keith Haring. (And someone named Ariel Allen.) I admire how he committed to every line — it looks like he never thought twice. I wondered what he would draw today, and it inspired me to create this piece. ¶ I just quit working at a production factory because of unsafe work conditions. People would literally pass out on the production floor, or a Willy Wonka–like pipe would come down upon their heads. When I heard loud voices off in the distance, I would tell myself that the overworked people were just laughing — not screaming. ¶ No one is really in that building because they want to be there. They have to be in there to pay their rent.

I think Keith Haring might have drawn something similar to this. Hungry Hungry Factory Workers.
