What is the capitalist algorithm after all but a machine that runs on money?

And running the machine are the people who create, lend, charge interest and fees on that money. They skim it right off the top of banking transactions, the stock exchange, currency trading, money marts, and user fees.

The big question is, can we reprogram the algorithm?

Can we rewrite the rules?

Reverse money flows and reset the machine?

Can enough of us wake up to the fact that the capitalist algorithm is a doomsday machine and then go about creatively destroying it?
