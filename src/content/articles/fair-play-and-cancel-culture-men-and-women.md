because the field is now everywhere. so -called cancel culture reminds me of an unpleasant experience my younger sister had many years ago, before the internet. in grade school she fell in with a group of girls whose primary recreation, it seemed, was identifying the next girl to be singled out, humiliated, and ritually shunned. an altogether different kind of combat sport. when it was my sister ’s turn, for some reason, the abuse turned weirder and darker, with threats, stalking, and phone calls to the family home at all hours. no one laid a finger on her, but the episode terrified her. my parents and her teachers agreed it would be best if she missed the last six weeks of grade seven. 

ask jk rowling about the pile-on, shaming, and character assassination, in her case amplified exponentially by the internet . of the thoughtful things written lately about cancel culture, many ask when young liberals became so dogmatic and censorious. my question is this: if we can readily identify examples of the old-fashioned brutality and awfulness of patriarchy, might we now, in the post-patriarchy, be seeing an emerging new brutality—one less violent (physically), but vastly more totalizing? might cancel culture’s essential character be feminine?
