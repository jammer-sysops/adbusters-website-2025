Chuck won't shut up about supply and demand chains and how our economy will never be what it once was... he's a dinosaur now...

Maverick economics everywhere are on a rampage. They're determined to kill off all the remaining "logic freaks" ... come up with real measures of progress ... make all markets true-cost ... outlaw derivatives ... abolish flash trading ... ultimately make usury taboo.

They have a grand vision of a whole new science - **they're calling it "bionomics" ... The Queen of all the Sciences** ... the melting together of economics, psychology, sociology, biology, political science ... all the disciplines, sciences and arts bundled together in a new interdisciplinary endeavour that will keep this human swarm of ours on Planet Earth on even keel through the desperate times ahead.
