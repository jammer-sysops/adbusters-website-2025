(Keep in mind that these are the same settlements whose state sponsored expansion, for seventy years, has placed “members of one ethnic group under military government while it confiscated their land,” as Nathan Thrall puts it.) Rather, “the fact of the matter,” according to Schumer, “is that too many Palestinians and too many Arabs do not want any Jewish state in the Middle East.” Could it not be the case, Chuck, that many Palestinians do not want an *apartheid* state in the Middle East?

As for annexation, last year she said that it “undermines U.S. national security interests.” Never mind the U.S., Speaker Pelosi — what about Palestinians’ interests, security, and nationhood?

To date, according to Thrall, the U.S. “has granted more than $110 billion to the occupying military force and spent hundreds of millions on upgrading the infrastructure of apartheid.” Blinken reaffirmed that thoroughly amoral position in early March, declaring that the U.S. “firmly opposes and is deeply disappointed” by the International Criminal Court’s opening an investigation into war crimes in occupied Palestine.

![Image](/images/articles/biden-complicit-466x600.gif)Diplomats and well-meaning anti-occupation groups greet every new act of Israeli expansion with dire warnings that it will be a 'fatal blow' to the two-state solution, that 'the window is closing' for Palestinian statehood and that now, on the eve of this latest takeover, it is 'five minutes to midnight' for the prospect of peace. Countless alarms of this kind have been rung during the past two decades. Each was supposed to convince Israel, the US, Europe and the rest of the world of the need to stop or at least slow Israel's de facto annexation. But they have had the opposite effect: demonstrating that it will *always *be five minutes to midnight. European and American policymakers, together with the liberal Zionist groups that lobby them, can thus maintain that the two-state solution isn't dead but merely embattled - and, therefore, permanently 'alive'. In the meantime, millions of Palestinians continue to be deprived of basic civil rights and subjected to military rule. With the exception of those six months in 1966-67, this has been the reality for the majority of Palestinians living under Israeli control for the entire history of the state. South Africa's apartheid lasted 46 years. Israeli's is at 72, and counting.-- from The Annexation Delusion by Nathan Thrall in the London Review of Books
