If you’ve been out of the dating trenches for a while, know this: A recent Pew Research Center survey found that fully half of single adults have given up on looking for a relationship at all. Sexual activity, partnership and marriage have all reached 30-year lows.

“I don’t think older generations realize how TERRIFYING dating is for the current generation,” fumed one young Twitter user, and got 18,000 likes.

Christine Emba, author of Rethinking Sex: A Provocation, found that women in particular talked about their sexual encounters in visceral terms: encounters that end in unexpected and alarming acts like choking or other porn-inspired violence.

What’s going on here? What is to become of a culture in which intimacy is so degraded? What hope is there when so many of us no longer know how to get together and love each other?

Capitalism is creating a fundamentally different breed of individual. We're separated, body and soul. Mutual aid is as foreign to the modern American mind as universal health care.

Killing capitalism means fundamentally remaking the kinds of people we are... our individualism... our selfishness... our loneliness... Maybe getting together and loving each other is the first step we can take to stave off the total mental breakdown of the human race.
