Before the story was even published, Israel had already put its sanitizing spin on it.

[Veteran Al Jazeera journalist](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/12/funeral-service-shireen-abu-akleh-set-start-ramallah) Shireen Abu Akleh wasn’t *murdered* by the Israeli Defence Forces while covering an IDF raid in the occupied West Bank. No: according to Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi, the army “cannot determine by whose fire she was harmed.” Hell, it may even have been a stray shot from a Palestinian firearm. But rest assured, we’ll get to the bottom of it: the IDF is “[investigating](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-in-the-investigation-into-shireen-s-death-too-no-one-will-be-found-guilty-1.10794014).”

In truth, it was a calculated propaganda ploy. Israel put its “who knows” spin on the incident right from the start. Soon it reached the top of the news cycle on TV, in most newspapers, and on much of the internet. In other words, the world’s media fell for it — and the outrage of the people was blunted.

Israel’s disinformation trick worked. And while the wider world looked on, deceived, the cause of Palestinian justice suffered another demoralizing blow.

Time to wake up!
