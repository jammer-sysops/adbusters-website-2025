We, the people of Earth are now speaking with one voice. And we demand some systemic changes:

## Fairness:

We want all tax havens eliminated.

## Honesty:

We want true-cost markets that tell the ecological truth.

## Justice:

We want the corporate death penalty reinstated. Break the law three times and yours charter is revoked.

## Accountability:

We want surveillance on the internet curbed.

## Transparency:

We want 99 percent of all government secrecy eliminated.

## Democracy:

Starting a war is illegal unless 50% of voters support it.

‍

This is the new normal, dear leaders ... from now on we the people are going to start calling the shots from below.
