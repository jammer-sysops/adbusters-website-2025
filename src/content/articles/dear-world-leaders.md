We, the people of Earth are now speaking with one voice. And we demand some systemic changes:

![people world voice](/images/articles/5f371b3ead9cd8a700a8bda2_people_world_voice_590x380_1.jpg)#### Fairness:
We want all tax havens eliminated.

#### Honesty:
We want true-cost markets that tell the ecological truth.

#### Justice:
We want the corporate death penalty reinstated. Break the law three times and yours charter is revoked.

#### Accountability:
We want surveillance on the internet curbed.

#### Transparency:
We want 99 percent of all government secrecy eliminated.

#### Democracy:
Starting a war is illegal unless 50% of voters support it.

‍

This is the new normal, dear leaders ... from now on we the people are going to start calling the shots from below.
