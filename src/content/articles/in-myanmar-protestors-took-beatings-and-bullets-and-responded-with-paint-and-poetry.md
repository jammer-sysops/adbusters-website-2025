Protestors in Myanmar are bringing a [righteous form of beauty](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/world/asia/myanmar-coup-protest-art.html) to the streets, defying the military regime that overthrew the country's civilian government in early February. Having faced beatings and bullets, demonstrators are responding with spray paint and poetry — vibrant expressions of a civil-disobedience movement not easily cowed by the [notoriously brutal](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56228357) junta.

A ubiquitous symbol of resistance among protestors is the three-finger salute, borrowed from [like-minded activists in Thailand](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/world/asia/thai-protesters-flash-hunger-games-salute-to-register-quiet-dissent.html) who in turn adopted the gesture from *The Hunger Games*. The salute features prominently in the protest art of online collectives such as [Art for Freedom](https://www.artforfreedommm.com/), whose mission is to "share art for common use" which promotes the "will of the Myanmar people against the military coup in Myanmar."

Another anti-coup icon, designed by the illustrator known as [Kuecool](https://twitter.com/thekuecoolkid), is an image depicting a young woman dressed in a sarong, wielding a wok in one hand and a spatula in the other. As in much of the protest movement's art, the image's red background represents the party color of the [National League for Democracy](https://nld-official.org/en/), whose leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is the deposed state counsellor of Myanmar. Suu Kyi was [jailed by the military](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/world/asia/myanmar-coup.html) during the coup.

References to the "[Milk Tea Alliance](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-protests-asia-idUSKCN2AS0HP)" also feature in countless protest images and social-media posts. The name points to milky drinks popular in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, where like-minded activists have launched demonstrations in solidarity with those in Myanmar. (India and Indonesia, too, are sometimes included among the Alliance.)

It's all the visual manifestation of a massive popular uprising intent on resisting dictatorship and restoring democracy. On February 22, a [nationwide general strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/world/asia/myanmar-general-strike.html) drew millions into the streets. The crowds included civil servants and doctors, cashiers and oil-rig operators — suggesting that a broad swath of the population is fed up with the junta's injustices. The strike came in the wake of a bloody weekend during which two unarmed demonstrators were shot dead by police, one of whom was 16 years old. 

Despite the deaths, the detention of hundreds, and the military's ever-tightening grip on civil society, the movement remains "unbowed, unbent, unbroken."
