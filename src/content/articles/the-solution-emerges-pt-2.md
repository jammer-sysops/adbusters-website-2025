The new accounting starts with the little stuff: plastic bags, coffee cups, paper napkins. 

Let’s say the eco-costs turn out to be five cents per plastic bag, ten cents per cup and a fraction of a cent per paper napkin. We tack those on. Of course we’re already doing that with the various fees and taxes included in the price of tires, cans of paint and other products. But now we abandon the concept of ancillary fees and taxes and start implementing true-cost pricing across the board, from factory to doorstep.

This is the first step toward True Cost: a global marketplace in which the price of every product tells the ecological truth.
