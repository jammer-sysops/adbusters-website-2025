“Why has god abandoned us!” he cried, teary eyed, to the heavens."

## “You’re looking in the wrong place,” said God;

“I am here, where I’ve always been:

in the warblings of the brook,
the whisperings of the trees,

![Image](/images/articles/simon-wilkes-691856-unsplash-rough-edges.jpg)the sprays of the seas;
every beat of a butterfly’s wing, &
every tweet of a bird in the spring,

![Image](/images/articles/jan-meeus-618850-unsplash-rough-edges.jpg)is me.”

‍

“It was you who abandoned me,

when you resigned me to life in heaven.”
