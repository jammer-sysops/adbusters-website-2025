After more than 70 years of diplomatic non-recognition, last year the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco all joined Egypt and Jordan in “normalizing” ties with Israel. The deal, strong-armed by Trump, was one they couldn’t afford to refuse: the leaders of each country were offered a big, juicy bone in return for siding with the big dog in the yard. Or else.

Yet the vast majority of people across the Middle East and North Africa oppose an Arab–Israeli detente. According to a survey of more than 28,000 people conducted last year by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, only 13% of Egyptians and Sudanese support their respective country’s recognition of Israel, while a mere 6% of Jordanians do. Enthusiasm among Moroccans is even lower — a paltry 4% are behind rapprochement. Meanwhile, in staunchly Israel-opposed Algeria, a stunning 0% would back it. 

Clearly, the concocted “peace” that exists between Israel and this handful of Arab states is an anti-democratic, top-down affair that does not represent the will of the people.
