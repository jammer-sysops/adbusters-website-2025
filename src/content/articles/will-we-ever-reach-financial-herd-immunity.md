Speculative money is spreading the virus of capitalism.

The financial pandemic is out of control — because there are no borders or governors or effective laws to stop the money-begets-money-begets-money algorithm. The speculative traders are like superspreaders, and the whole world is vulnerable. 

Our only hope is to shut those guys down. We must flatten the money curve. First we move our money en-masse out of the big banks and reverse the money flows whichever way we can. Then we eliminate tax havens, impose holding rules on stock trades and push a global Robin Hood Tax through. We make it harder and harder for speculators to ply their unholy trade. Bit by bit, we reduce the money sloshing around the internet every day from $3-trillion to $2-trillion to $1-trillion . . . and then down to a modest $500-million. Slowly the supply of bad money shrinks and the supply of good money, money that’s doing honest work, grows. 

As we flatten the speculative money curve, things for all of us all around the world will gradually get better — until eventually we reach financial herd immunity.
