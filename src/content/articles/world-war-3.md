The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist, was carried out by Israel's Mossad using an autonomous machine gun.

Russia is developing an undersea Poseidon nuclear torpedo that can travel across an ocean under its own guidance, evading existing missile defenses to deliver a nuclear weapon days after it is launched.

This is the brace new frontier of the 21st century warfare. Nothing will stop the current crop of nuclear powers from pushing their autonomous warfare capabilities to the limit. It will be an arms race like no other (with China quite likely coming out on top).

Will autonomous killer robots lock out their human creators and duke it out in WW3? 

Is a ghost-nukes showdown between the forces of autocracy and democracy inevitable?

Only We the People of the world, coming together for the first time in history as a global community, can stop the madness.
