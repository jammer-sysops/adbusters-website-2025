EACH MORNING I WAKE UP

AND FIND MYSELF IN A LULL.

AM I PATHETIC?

AM I NOT INFORMED?

CORPORATIONS DOMINATE MORE

NOW THAN THEY EVER HAVE AT

ANY TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY,

BUT I FEEL NOTHING.

‚Äç

THEY GOVERN THE WATER,

THE AIR, THE FOOD, THE SKIES,

THE RADIO WAVES, THE ENERGY,

THE GOVERNMENTS, THE

COMMERCIAL SPACES, THE

INTERNET, THE EDUCATION SYSTEM,

THE MENTAL ENVIRONMENT . . .

NOT A SINGLE THING IS BEYOND

THEIR REACH ANYMORE.

HOW DID IT COME TO THIS?

AND WHY DON'T I CARE?
