A young corporate go-getter in Shenzen, China, on the fast track in her design career, suddenly quit to become a pet groomer. She swapped her fancy wardrobe for a uniform, and took an eighty-percent pay cut. When she told her story to a couple of *New York Times *reporters recently, Loretta Liu could barely contain her delight. 

“I was tired of living like that,” she said.

By *like that, *she meant squeezed by the deal of the capitalist ticket-to-ride: insane work hours, demanding bosses and stress levels that crushed her physical and mental health.

But the reporters found plenty of examples that it’s really happening among Gen Y and Z Chinese: a tech worker becoming grocery store cashier; a content manager delivering takeout; an accountant selling sausages on the street. Young Chinese opting for honest, humble blue-collar work over white-collar abstraction. Even if it means forgoing the promised lifestyle of the materialist dream.

## Everyone said some variation of: *This was *someone's *plan for my life, but it wasn't my plan. And it doesn't make me happy. So fuck it. I opt out.*

Call it the next phase of the “great unraveling.” During the pandemic, when the world shut down, many furloughed employees found they ... quite liked having a life. Turns out, regular sleep and time to think and meals with your family are pleasant things. When Covid was reined in and businesses opened back up, a lot of workers just ... stayed home. In the US it was dubbed “the great resignation.” In China: *tang-ping: *literally, “lying flat.”

This great pushback, a reframing of what work actually means to individual humans, appears to be truly global impulse. And it can no longer just be chalked up to the existential scare of a lethal virus. The pivot that many young people in both the world’s superpowers are making rises above ideology. It seems the capitalist paradigm is no match for a kind of mass apprehension of a kind of basic calculus: *my life vs a bullshit job*. Yeah, I’ll take the life.
