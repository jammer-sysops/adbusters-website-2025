Dear people of the Adbusters Media Foundation,

We are Afra van den Hoogen, Mila Vuckovic and Nick Verkroost; three first year students of the Audiovisual Media-studies at the University of the Arts in Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Last semester we followed a subject about 'culture jamming', for which we created a poster about this subject.

Our professor, a big fan of your initiative, talked a lot about your foundation during the classes and told us our poster fits right in with your magazine.

That's why we decided to send you this e-mail; we hope you appreciate it as much as our professor does.

Kind regards,

Afra van den Hoogen, Mila Vuckovic and Nick Verkroost
