Study after study has shown that using Facebook all the time makes people feel moody, anxious, and depressed.

Pre-teens are especially vulnerable . . . they are much less likely to hang out with friends, less likely to date, less likely to work . . . less likely to actually live.

High school students who spend over ten hours a week on social media are twice as likely to say they feel sad . . . their risk of depression shoots up 25 percent . . . they also think about suicide more often.

Younger generations don't put much stock in religion, but their souls are being uploaded to the Cloud every day.
