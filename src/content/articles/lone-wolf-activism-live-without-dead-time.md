The only thing that gives me satisfaction lately is going out and getting my nose dirty. Pulling off some little act of subversion — like placing an OUT OF ORDER sign on an ATM, or taping an *Ultimatum to World Leaders *poster on a bus stop shelter. Once in awhile I’ll drop	by the economics department of the University of British Columbia and pin *KICKITOVER MANIFESTOs *on professors’ doors. In future I might, I dunno, let the air out of some SUV tires; place a stink bomb in a bank; throw a handful of pixel dust in Justin Trudeau’s face. Such acts of civil disobedience aren’t exactly denting the universe. But they always turn my day around. Like, now I have the strength to fight another day.

I wonder if a lot of people around the world feel the same way. That the old activism — marching back and forth across our cities waving banners and chanting slogans — just doesn’t hack it anymore. To repair the climate, keep corporations in check, shift economic paradigms, vanquish the mindlords and fix the the really big scary existential stuff, we need a more intimate, visceral kind of activism — a revolutionary fervor from the inside out.

Taking back our lives in these these dark times is going to require a big swing. We need to rethink what the world is asking of us, and plug back in to what human agency actually feels like. So here’s the deal: Monday to Thursday it’s business as usual. But Fridays are ours. On Fridays we raise hell. We bug out, fan out, and morph into fired up world-changers who put our asses on the line in service of one message:

*We don’t like what’s going on. Fuck man, we’re going to change it.*

As the stakes rise, life on Earth grows scarier and more intense, and this whole human experiment edges toward hyper-capitalist oblivion, maybe this kind of individual spasm response, at scale, can turn things around.
