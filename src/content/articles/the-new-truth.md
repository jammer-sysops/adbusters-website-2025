![Image](/images/articles/math-formula-theory-600x600.jpg)This is how scientific progress is supposed to happen: A theory, a paradigm, that has worked quite well for many years suddenly becomes problematic. Contradictions emerge; the theory no longer seems to predict reality. The scientific community senses the moment and rises to the occasion. A flurry of experiments are conducted, information shared, papers written, conferences held. Out of this intellectual turmoil, a new theory emerges. It is subjected to rigorous scrutiny and tested in a myriad of ways. Then, if it passes muster, it is finally accepted as the new theoretical framework, the new norm, the new “truth.” The scientists who came up with the breakthrough are nominated for the Nobel Prize. The community settles back down, but now with a greater understanding of how the world really works.
