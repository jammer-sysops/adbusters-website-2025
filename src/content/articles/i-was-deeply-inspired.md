I found you years ago and was deeply inspired. I never missed an issue until they started changing. The
overall feeling had become extremely masculine and desperate, and I was forced to let go of a magazine
I dearly loved. I see that you use the word “brutal” in your campaign as though it were a good thing, but I
think it alienates people.
