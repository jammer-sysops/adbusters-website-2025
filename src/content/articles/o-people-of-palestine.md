> Marwan Barghouti: Palestine's Mandela Political Prisoner of Israel
‍

You, a people "in love with life," as Darwish put it, have shown you are not afraid to die defending your homes and family and honor.

And in the end you will win.

Because you have the strength of the just and, increasingly, the sympathy of the world on your side.

Your will be remembered as one of the great freedom fights of the 21st century.
