Long before we humans existed, the lonely Earth cooled and the sun shone upon it until one day, Hallelujah, life strikes up out of the soup.

Three and a half billion years later here we are with the tools we've fashioned to make things easier for ourselves: Super computers and AI and UberEats and everything we could possibly want just the click of a button away. We've made art, built civilizations, unfurled the mysteries of the cosmos, and hell . . . didn't we make it all the way to the moon! And all because the sun was shining down upon us.

That's what makes what has happened in the last half-century so dispiriting. We've pushed life on Earth and squeezed it and expanded it and now we're destroying it.

How did things go from that to this? The Earth's simple gift of abundant sunshine to the takers we have become — voracious marauders who can't stop consuming, can't stop spewing carbon into the atmosphere, can't stop producing waste?

Frederich Hunterwasser's quote says it all. The history of our species in eight words. What came next is on us: the tragic coda of how we mucked it all up.
