Adbusters - Be Changed

[![Palestinian child](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5ab163de19104964ce8a64b9/68ae11c73a49ba2fdb014455_palestinian%20child.jpg)](https://www.adbusters.org/#palestine-last-hope)

## Be Changed

If you feel like Gaza has changed you



hold on to this feeling



it's humanity



insisting on existing

If you are filled with rage



at Western atrocities



be not gaslit

Fuck their bipolarities



you HAVE been betrayed

Be crazy in love



with Palestine

Do not mourn the death of the West



things are going south

Terror feeds the culture war vultures



fat with futile phrases from cucked-up leaders



drunk on destruction, bent on denial

If you feel your anger has changed you



hold on to that feeling



Fuck the tone police

Find your new center

Only solidarity softens the blow



We keep us safe

That is our birthright



In our millions, in our billions

Justice is the nectar of the sunbirds



In the name of all that might be holy

We exist



To Co-Resist

Free, free, Palestine

â€” Kat Dodds

You be the force
