**As soon as we have fifty thousand members signed up, we will hold a communal brainstorm and decide what the next step in our evolution should be.**

**OUR PROMISE TO YOU:**

We'll hire the most decent, smart and competent humans to run every leadership position in every government department. We'll make being a civil servant one of the most prestigious and desirable jobs any young person could ever aspire to — a values-based calling.

We'll make sure that every court case wraps up within a year. Same with health care: no civilized country makes its citizens suffer waiting interminably to be attended to.

Trump fired 300,000 federal workers; we go in the opposite direction, we'll hire a million and make it work.

Don't think this can't be done. The fact is that it's never really been tried.

Any party that gives this kind of intimate person-to-person service to its citizens — and does it well — is sure to win the next election.
