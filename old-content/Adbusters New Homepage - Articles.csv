Slavoj Žižek reminds us that such oscillation indexes the “too much or too little” of jouissance. For psychoanalysis, particularly in Lacan’s teaching, jouissance is a special substance, that intense pleasure-pain of enjoyment that makes life worth living and some things worth dying for. We will do anything to get what we think we will enjoy. After we get it we discover that it wasn’t what we really desired after all. Likewise, we try to discipline, regulate, and control enjoyment, only to find it emerging in another place. We get off even when we think we are trying not to. Jouissance is what we want but can’t get and what we get that we don’t want.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:612px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""612px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18a47353f690c2f702974a_Glacier-with-text.jpg""></div></figure><p>Some use climate change as a vehicle for jouissance, for enjoying destruction, punishment, and knowing. A current of Left anthropocenic enjoyment circulates through evocations of unprecedented, unthinkable catastrophe: the end of the world, the end of the human species, the end of civilization. Theorists embrace extinction, focus on deep time, and displace a politics of the people onto the agency of things. Postmodern Augustinians announce the guilt or hypocrisy of the entire human species. Hubris is humanity’s, all of humanity’s, downfall. Philosophers and cultural critics take on the authoritative rhetoric of geoscientists and evolutionary biologists. Those of us who follow the reports of emissions, extreme weather, and failed states enjoy being in the know. We can’t do anything about climate change, but this lets us off the hook when we stop trying.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18a48cac26661a284a1607_Warming_Seas_and_Melting_Ice_Sheets_web.jpg""></div></figure><p>The perfect storm of planetary catastrophe, species condemnation, and paralyzed incapacity allows the Left a form of jouissance that ongoing deprivation, responsibility, and struggle do not allow.

Left anthropocenic enjoyment thrives on the disaster that capitalist enjoyment produces. In this circuit, captivation in enjoyment fuels the exploitation, expropriation, and extraction driving the capitalist system: more, more, more; endless circulation, dispossession, destruction, and accumulation; ceaseless, limitless death. Incapacitated by magnitude, boggled by scale, the Left gets off on moralism, complexity, and disaster—even as the politics of a capitalist class determined to profit from catastrophe continues.<br><br>--Jodi Dean, The Anamorphic Politics of Climate Change</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18a47353f690c2f702974a_Glacier-with-text.jpg,"Climate change tethers us to a perspective that oscillates between the impossible and the inevitable, already and not yet, everywhere but not here, not quite.

You have had enough. You’re tired of screen-based self-obsession, compulsive habits, anxiety and depression. So you are relinquishing your smartphones. You are disconnecting from Social Media. You are meeting in person. You are reading books, making art and listening to the wind in the trees. You are trying to think and create outside the Internet. You recognize your mental imprisonment and seek liberation.</p><p id="""">You were born with a barcode across your forehead. Surveillance capitalists have reduced your personood to data streams, which you must surrender to in order to function in society. This unprecedented violation, on a mass scale, of Immanuel Kant’s famous moral maxim “Never treat a human being as a means only, but also as an end,” is now normal. Today, children learn to say “Hey, Google!” before they can read. </p><p id="""">You are not alone. Parents are waking up, too. Where I live in Vancouver, B.C., our family banded together with other like-minded parents who wanted their kids to grow up phone-free, to learn self-sufficiency, not tech dependency. My 15 year-old daughter and 11 year-old son have never had a cell phone, and they don’t want one. They and their phone-free friends walk without fear to and from school, hang out in parks, and go out for ice cream. My daughter starting riding the city bus alone at age 11, without a phone.</p><p id="""">Phone-free kids gain skills — such as identifying a plant species without an app or navigating without GPS — that make them proud and feel good about themselves. They read books that cannot spy on them, and use libraries that don’t use “cookies” to “better serve” them. Their social lives are not confiscated by social media. Their minds are free from marketing “influencers.” They know how to deal with boredom; they have no cell phone to fill the void with instant, fidgety, dopaminergic gratification, so they find their own intrinsic, creative energy instead. They learn that people, on the whole, can be trusted.</p><p id="""">True independence for kids means using their own wits, know-how, resources, and creativity without an electronic parental leash and corporate-sponsored apps that make them more, not less, dependent on forces outside themselves. Phone-free kids at least have half a chance of entering the online world consciously, deliberately, and critically, as opposed to obliviously, habitually, and passively.</p><p id="""">Many people will say this refusalism is too “negative” about technology. But for decades the positive case was rammed down our throats. We heard ad nauseum about the power and promise of the “information superhighway,” the “game-changing” magic of smartphones, and the network potential of “connecting” on social media. We let every aspect of human life go online. We went along with it, we accepted it, most even embraced it.</p><p id="""">Just remember: Your luddite stance is a positive act. In this case the negative is the positive. You are helping people wake up to the possibilities: kids everywhere untethered from technology and the commercial forces operating through it. Parents letting their kids experience the exhilaration of making their own way in the world. Citizens refusing to accept an Internet predicated on concentrated, unaccountable corporate power, data extraction and accumulation, ubiquitous surveillance, assaults on privacy, and hidden manipulation at scale. And when people tell us, “You can’t stop progress,” we will tell them, “You can stop calling it progress and call it profiteering, scamming and mass addiction instead.”</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/642f09249276916ed3d591de_luddites-v3.gif,"I applaud you.

Too few put down their phones long enough to vote in the 2016 election, and mocking them is a supremely satisfying pastime. But, hold on: they are also the most informed and forward-looking cohort in history. They’re unafraid of change, and their lie detectors are first rate. Can millennials — the maligned generation — suddenly click, become revolutionary, and take us into uncharted territory?</p><p>I remember the first time I heard the word—<em>Millennial</em>. It must have been the earlyish mid-90s, because we were playing Wolfenstein 3D and listening to Nirvana.<br><br>Somewhere between the chunky sprites of Nazi blood and <em>All Apologies</em>, a teacher hushed the classroom and mouthed a pronouncement. We were to be known as “The Millennial Generation.”<br><br>Whoop.<br><br>To be of the Millennial Generation, we were told, was to be optimism incarnate. We belonged to the future, and it to us, and everything was coming up aces.<br><br>The pop sociologists who coined the term, Neil Howe and William Strauss, predicted that Millennials, reared under the watchful eye of helicopter parents, would establish themselves as well-behaved conformists with a bent to civic-minded altruism. In other words, a poignant rebuttal to the disaffection, atomization, and slackerdom of Gen X, with their McJobs and inexhaustible irony.In the face of creeping economic complexity, Millennials would instinctively adapt to the arcane demands of a high-tech postindustrial society. All the while being committed to building up social institutions, rather than tearing them down, like their Boomer parents.<br><br>O, to be a prelapsarian Millennial again. Things were good. Life was simple. Cartoons came on after school and you could nuke a miniature pizza in under three minutes. Soon enough, we’d all ascend to an adulthood spent telecommuting from beachside verandas, listening to jazztronica at responsible volumes on our Mini CDs.<br></p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c3abd09224d7bb292275_Yellow-Fruit.jpg""></div></figure><p>It didn’t take long for that future to sour.<br><br>Soon after learning we were <em>Millennials</em>, the <em>Millennium</em> was upon us. That great threshold-crossing to the 2000s—the canvas onto which so much apocalyptic paint was thrown—rapidly become synonymous with paranoia, anxiety, and doom.</p><h2><strong>The first doom wave was spectral:<br>a phantom bug was coming to smash our world</strong></h2><p>Sometime in the mid-80s, a handful of computer scientists began wringing their hands over the possibility of a glitch occurring when the clock struck midnight on December 31, 1999.<br><br>A glitch with the capacity to end the world, as <em>Time</em> hyperventilated on its cover. Markets would crash. Nuclear subs would malfunction. Planes would fall from the sky.<br><br>Myopic creatures, we’d only ever recorded the year with two digits. And when that ‘99 rolled over to ‘00, they said, computers everywhere—thinking it was January 1, 1900—would go haywire. By Hallowe’en 1999, the global panic claxon of Y2K was earsplitting; the US government alone spent 100 million dollars in preparation.<br><br>That New Year’s Eve, as the ball dropped on Times Square, cops were out in force, Glocks cocked, while millions of office drones clocked overtime, staring at the blinking cursor, waiting for the world to burn.</p><h2><strong>The second wave was speculative:<br>fake companies crashed a fake market.</strong></h2><p>Misleading statistics. Irrational exuberance. The promise of unlimited wealth. Fuck the middlemen; we’ll sell pet food directly to the consumer!<br><br>Everyone got really excited about the internet once you could use it to buy stuff. So much so that they poured billions of dollars into a new type of venture that was so bleeding edge it didn’t need to turn a profit: the Silicon Valley startup. Then Fed chair Alan Greenspan slashed interest rates, the dot-com bubble inflated in kind, and the subsequent burst taught everyone a dread lesson. Capital tilts against those without it. And when it does, it’s average people left holding the bag.</p><h2><strong>The third wave was terrifying:<br>Where were you?</strong></h2><p>Achingly clear blue sky. Another teacher, another hushed classroom. This time the pronouncement on our generation was bleak. Twin 747s had struck the twin towers in spectacular flashes of light, death, and jet fuel. The Kyoto Protocol was subsequently shredded and the Coalition of the Willing began a slaughter that has yet to stop. Cue Five Eyes. Cue Katrina. Cue Kanye West, attack dogs, drooling goons, and the steady tic, tic, tic of a culture crossing the point of no return.<br><br>All of which is to say, as Millennials watched the dust settle on the 20th century, the world they inhabited—the world that had been promised them—was manifestly a paranoid and perilous place, one where the baby monitor never got turned off.<br><br>With Millennials entering their formative years, one might have expected a proper revolt, given the blood and oil being everywhere spilt. But all the good-natured optimism and tech savvy found its parasitic muse in a revitalized Silicon Valley. It was the age of platforms—MySpace, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, 4chan, and more. Millennials made it possible for themselves to decamp for an alternate reality. One that ran parallel to the moral affront of the Bush years. One that they controlled.<br><br>It was the sound of velocity. Things that hadn’t existed a week ago suddenly became all-consuming. One minute you’d be stressing about who to put in your top eight. The next you’d be told that the great migration was under way—we were all abandoning MySpace for Facebook.<br><br>But you can’t even personalize your profile? <em>Yeah, dummy, that’s the point.</em></p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c3d4b89d6e5f43d1fba3_Fronch.png""></div></figure><h2><strong>Generation Me. Generation Selfie.<br>Generation Snowflake.</strong></h2><p>This is the point in the story where the crusty old journalists get their knives out to carve up the children. Who knew that criticizing the youth would turn out to be such a clickbait gold mine for Boomer columnists and their Gen X lackeys. Who knew there would be such glee.<br><br>They criticized Millennials for their upbringing and condemned them for their work ethic. They were lazy, shiftless, self-absorbed, narcissistic. They couldn’t get their shit together. Zero loyalty. Financially illiterate. Irritating. Just whiny little babies crying about every goddamned thing.<br><br>Sure, Millennials came of age during overlapping financial crises that saw a profound escalation in the transfer of wealth from the middle and working classes to the rich. Sure, speculation had fucked the housing market for anyone not already in it. And, sure, the cost of living in Western nations had skyrocketed while wages stagnated or declined. They would have to play a poor hand well.<br><br>True to form, Millennials went from precocious to precarious with style. If one job didn’t pay the bills, we’d get side hustles. If that didn’t do the trick, we’d drive strangers around in our cars. If it still wasn’t enough, we’d fuck each other on a livestream for loose change. And if we were still left wanting? We’d monetize our personalities and trade influence over peers for branded merch.</p><p>Of all the Millennial stereotypes, only one ever rang true—distraction. The ADHD generation, we were plagued by intermittent concentration and an inability to see the forest for the giant gun pointed at our collective face.<br><br>For all the time and emotion we poured into social media, we never looked much past the surface, so caught up were we in the dopamine tunnel of poking and following and hearting. Addicts of the convenience of constant connection, we failed to grasp how truly revolutionary was the tools in our hands.<br><br>Plug in your phone and the kinetic turns electrical. From a far-off dam or coal plant, electrons flow through a loop into substations and aluminum lines, poles and drums, the charge finally entering the knotted-up fire hazard of white plastic cords that connect your Instagram account to the now-drowned corpses of woodland caribou.<br><br>Connected. Everything is connected.<br><br>Our relationship with our tools is chiastic. Not only are we Jonah, swallowed up by the algorithmic whale, but the whale is also us, swallowing everything else.<br><br>When we begin to untangle the mess of wires in which we’re ensnared, we see the strangeness of this landscape, of our politics, ecology, and technology.

A Zeitgeist-probing follow-up called The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy quickly became a Steve Bannon favourite; it predicted that within two years America would suffer a major upheaval, finally reaching a crescendo of crisis equivalent to “nature’s raging typhoon, the kind that sucks all surrounding matter into a single swirl of ferocious energy.

It’s about killing everything so one plant can grow. “You could argue that modern agriculture has brought about the most wholesale ecocide on the planet by killing the astonishingly rich microbial life of the soil,” writes Verlyn Klinkenborg for <em>The New York Review of Books</em>. Scraping away layer after layer of fertile, living soil, industrial farmers since the 19th century “simply mined their way downward … until they reached the place we are now.” That is, at the barren limit of rock bottom.</strong></p><p>The implications of fertility-depleted farmlands reach well beyond the earth beneath our feet — and into the atmosphere above our heads. “Mega-sized farming encourages practices that degrade the soil, waste fertilizer and mishandle manure, all of which directly increase emissions of greenhouse gases,” according to Georgina Gustin of <em>Inside Climate News</em>. “At the same time, it discourages practices like ‘no-till’ farming and crop rotation that grab carbon dioxide from the air, store it in the soil and improve soil health.”</p><p>How did our relationship with our food become so destructive, parasitic, and unsustainable? In days of yore, when unclaimed (read: unceded) land was plentiful and laboring hands were comparatively few, the ideal farm was “self-provisioning” — producing a variety of crops in a time-honored rotation, abundantly enough for a single farmsteading family to eat and exchange for other necessaries.</p><p>But by the mid-20th century, the species of the self-sufficient, family-operated small farm had all but gone extinct. In its place metastasized a cancer of massive industrial monocultures run by multinational corporations.</p><p>More and more land is concentrating in the hands of fewer and richer people. “More than a third of cropland is on farms bigger than 2,000 acres,” Gustin writes. “That’s twice the share of land held on big farms 30 years ago.” On the government’s dime, that land is producing a shrinking diversity of crops — mostly, only the fertilizer-guzzling duo of corn and soybeans. Subsidies go to farms that produce this topsoil-eroding pair on the largest scale and are supplied seeds, chemicals, and even practical demands by huge corporations like Monsanto.</p><p>In a word, agribusiness has gone the way of the fossil-fuels industry: ruthlessly consolidated and recklessly extractive, with a powerful army of lobbyists taming Washington into submission.</p><p>Here’s what needs to happen — a pie-in-the-sky but desperately needed vision that will have legs only if We the People get our shit together. We have to hit corporations hard, right where it hurts. Yank away their corporate charters unless they can show that they will act for the public good. Implement a True-Cost regime that puts the price of gut-rotting foods where it should be: way above the price of healthy, unprocessed — and, yes, affordable ones. And get national food guides out from under the thumbs of the same companies that sell us all that junk . . . and into the hands of the people, so they can be re-written to include the facts, not propaganda.</p><p>Who’s going to do all this? Not the government. Certainly not the corporations. It’s up to us — the revolutionary Third Force, a new kind of resistance, a movement that operates completely outside of geographic borders and political structures — to get it done.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/60ef30a469abb194b2a9c97a_agriculture_permaculture_600x882.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/60ef30a469abb194b2a9c97a_agriculture_permaculture_600x882.jpg,"Industrial farming is a war with nature.

There, a major Catholic shrine has attracted scores of millions of pilgrims since visionary apparitions beset a denizen in 1858. Some hundred and sixty years ago, at the nearby Grotto of Massabielle, an illiterate peasant named Bernadette Soubirous claimed to have received a rosary-like series visions of the Immaculate Conception. Destitute and sickly, the fourteen-year-old asserted that the Virgin Mary had instructed her to have a chapel built on the spot, the waters of which have been said ever since to possess supernatural healing properties. Despite being met initially with scepticism, Soubirous was deemed credible, then blessed, then a saint: she was canonized Saint Bernadette of Lourdes, patroness of bodily illness, in 1933. The fifty-odd-hectare site — called the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes or, colloquially, the “Domain” — offers the devout in their strictly allotted droves its coveted “Lourdes water” for bathing and drinking. In addition to the springs and the holy Grotto itself, the grounds of the Domain boast numerous places of worship, as well as the offices of the Lourdes Medical Bureau (for investigating claims of miraculous cures). Once centred economically on its prosperous market, greater Lourdes, with its rash of hotels and giftshops, now may best be described as a resort town.</p><p>It was in view of this hallowed ground that British photographer Alys Tomlinson grew curious about pilgrimage and pilgrims. “I’m not a person of any faith,” she has said, “but there was something in their simple faith that I found very moving.” Inspired by the film <em>Lourdes</em>, she set off to photograph “those who go to Lourdes and to create a narrative between the people and the landscape ... and the spirituality and sense of hope that permeates the Sanctuary of ‘Our Lady of Lourdes.’”</p><p>Tomlinson has made something of a specialty of her fascination with itinerant worship. “Ex-Voto,” her most recent collection of photographs, “is an extension of my previous work in Lourdes. Still intrigued by this place of great spiritual contemplation and worship, I re-visited the project,” named in this iteration for the offerings left at places of pilgrimage in thanks for answered prayers, “with a different approach.” Eschewing colour for the starker <em>chiaroscuro</em> of monochrome, she shot with a camera that seems of another century. “This camera is probably about an eighth of my body weight,” Tomlinson told <em>The Guardian</em>, “and you have to set [it] up using a tripod and a hood.” But these choices were no mere gimmicks: “Shooting in large format [<em>sic</em>] black and white slowed the process down and gave me space to think” — all too fitting for her solemn subject matter.</p><p>From landscapes to portraits to close-ups of the titular offerings, Tomlinson’s images situate the spiritual journeys of her pilgrims on the material paths of their vows. Reminiscent of the films of Andrei Tarkovsky or Paweł Pawlikowski, they exude a contemplative sort of melancholy; a meditative stillness that owes in part to Tomlinson’s weighty choice of camera. Crucifixes rubbed into rock or improvised from twigs; handwritten invocations folded, tucked into stony nooks and clefts; prayer leaflets and ribbon all litter the pilgrims’ trail, like markers. Cavernous hollows, woods, marshlands, lakes, and churchyards bound their passage with as much (nigh on pagan) sacred import. But the faces of the devout — all but upturned in faithful expectation — are the most compelling evidence to suggest that Tomlinson has photographed scenes not of today but out of Europe’s pre-modern past. Women dressed in nuns’ habits and men as monks or clerics — or, in one photograph, a young member of the military-religious Order of Malta in uniform — evoke an older, slower world ignorant of the coursing present.</p><p>What of that slower world? When today’s grinds to its inevitable halt, perhaps a glance inward, as in Tomlinson’s art, will provide the last sanctuary for the distressed conscience. The past that is conjured in “Ex-Voto,” in any case, may not be so different from the world yet to come; to be made primitive again by the errors of here and now. Under the surface of serene, religious calm, one can imagine an uneasy premonition of dread in “Ex-Voto.” If — when — that prophecy comes to be fulfilled, the introspective stillness of Tomlinson’s photographs may likewise foretell the bent of tomorrow’s aesthetics. Amid whatever after-storm quiet we may find, let us hope that we might garner the means within to realize such lasting peace — what we may well fail to bring about in the world we will leave behind.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5dcc7912cf5310fd68bd6787_horsey.jpg,"In the shadow of the colossal French Pyrenees, at the fringes of the historic region of Occitanie, lies the town of Lourdes.

As corny and old-fashioned as it may sound, we are waiting for guidance from god. I have been attending the Quaker Meeting for many years now and have felt increasing awe and reverence for this process by which Quakers conduct business. No shouting. No interrupting. Even the most timid, the most outlying or awkward person may be given time to gather her thoughts, to breathe and to speak, perhaps falteringly, even if she has to pause before continuing. People wait. It is quite amazing. I had never seen anything like it.</p><p>Quakers do not vote on issues but discuss, sometimes a lot, and tiringly. Members direct comments to the clerk. At its best, there is time for each person who wants to speak to be heard during the meeting. Instead of voting, we try to discern the “sense of the Meeting” before acting. We are trying to discern god’s will. And even one person can change the movement of the group as he or she feels led to speak. One voice can be the one to heed even if the whole group is going another way – because we believe that all have direct access to god’s guidance, no one person more than another. If the group has not gathered a sense of unity, then the meeting may decide to postpone action. We wait and listen more -- and try again at another meeting.</p><p>In this contentious time of lockdowns, isolations, staggering losses of livelihoods and social supports, then violence, snarling faces, flying opinions and accusations, burning buildings, crashing glass, and dizzying confusion of language and numbers and messages changing every day, I have longed to hear someone say those words: “Could we have some silence please?”</p><p>Flashing Internet images and slogans on social media and other web sites make me queasy. Anyone can create in seconds a poster with short texts or an image with a caption, and can immediately broadcast it to thousands, even millions. These patched-together messages blink and flash and multiply. I don’t use Twitter, don’t really understand it, but it sounds to me like something a 13-year old boy made up. Yet, we see public figures use haphazard phrases -- tweets (which sounds silly) that instantly become headlines in national newspapers. This cannot be good for our clear thinking or our culture.</p><p>Many at protests and riots hold up their devices, filming, and those films and images fill screens and minds. The Internet has changed our brains, as Nicholas Carr describes in his book, <em>The Shallows</em>. He describes how our attention spans have been shattered by clicking through short texts and flashing images as we are increasingly challenged to sustain even the concentration required to sit and read a whole book, for instance. Carr summarizes the findings of early computer scientist Joseph Weizenbuam, who notes the danger as we become more intimately involved with our computers and “experience more of our lives through the disembodied symbols flickering across our screens -- is that we’ll begin to lose our humanness, to sacrifice the very qualities that separate us from machines”.

Since we launched the “<a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/whitehousesiege-campaign"">White House Siege</a>” late in July, the far right’s conspiracy theory–fuelled propaganda machine has attempted to <a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/article/far-right-media-are-after-us-heres-what-we-think-of-them"">stoke outlandish fears</a>, falsely portraying us as violence-inciting, looting, pillaging bogeymen. In consequence, both our inbox and social media have been flooded with bloodthirsty <a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/the-pulse/from-hate-mail-to-hashtags"">expressions</a> of semi-literate hostility. We’ve been informed that we’ll be met by “armed militias.” We’ve been told to “get ready for war.” We’ve been threatened with being “taken away in body bags.” These threats, however, have all proved to be as empty as their authors’ skulls. Not one has amounted to anything more than keyboard-mediated bluster. </p><p>But then one month into our campaign, Facebook censored the hashtag #WhiteHouseSiege, citing violations of the company’s “community standards” (perhaps due to the rabid reaction outlined above). As a result, we were forced to do an about-face and run with an entirely different hashtag: #ReOccupy. Our efforts at <a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/whitehousesiege-campaign"">resuscitating democracy</a> undoubtedly suffered for it. For its part, Facebook’s complaints department has yet to get back to us with any clarification whatsoever. We’ll continue to bang and bang and bang on their door until we get a full explanation. And as soon as we get one, we’ll share it with you. </p><p>If it were merely an isolated incident, Facebook’s suppression of our campaign’s hashtag would stand as an affront to free speech everywhere. But in fact, as many of you will recognize, this was not an isolated incident. It is just one instance in a broad pattern of censorship on the part of technology companies. In their <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/technology/facebook-election-chaos-november.html"">haphazard scramble</a> to appease the growing crowd of critics who denounce the proliferation of propaganda on digital platforms, firms such as Facebook have suppressed not only <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content"">harmful misinformation and hate speech</a> but legitimate dissent like ours, too. </p><p>Take <a href=""https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/10/boycott-divestment-sanctions-movement-israel-palestine"">Zoom’s blocking of Leila Khaled</a>. One day before she and others, in partnership with San Francisco State University, were scheduled to conduct a roundtable discussion — titled “Whose Narratives? Gender, Justice and Resistance: A Conversation with Leila Khaled” — on Zoom, the video-conferencing platform cancelled the event, objecting to Khaled’s affiliation with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Instead, the discussion was streamed on YouTube and Facebook. But both platforms, following Zoom’s lead, swiftly terminated the feed. </p><p>Each company cited concerns that the lecture would violate policies prohibiting the endorsement of violent organizations on its platform. According to a spokesperson for Zoom, Khaled’s speaking at the event would have transgressed “certain limitations contained in our <a href=""https://zoom.us/terms"">Terms of Service</a>, including those related to user compliance with applicable U.S. export control, sanctions and anti-terrorism laws.” That is because the U.S. deems the Marxist-Leninist PFLP — which so happens to be a thorn in the side of Israel, a staunch American ally — a<a href=""https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/""> terrorist organization</a>. </p><p>In the late 1960s and early ‘70s, the PFLP carried out a string of aircraft hijackings that precipitated the Jordanian Civil War, also known as Black September. In 1969, a 25-year-old Khaled — who bears the singular distinction of being the “first female hijacker” — commandeered TWA Flight 840, from Rome to Tel Aviv, and held two passengers captive for several weeks. All parties walked away unscathed after the hostages were exchanged for prisoners of the state of Israel. Khaled went on to attempt a second hijacking the following year but was thwarted in the process. Now 76, she lives on in the radical imagination as an iconic revolutionary and feminist. </p><p>Prior to the event, San Francisco State had given Zoom assurances that Khaled, who would not be compensated for her participation, would speak on behalf no group or person but herself. Regardless, the freedom of expression is enshrined in law. It is not the job of corporations to control or curtail it as they see fit. Who are Zoom, Facebook, or YouTube to decide whether or not a university-sanctioned event should take place? Who are they to assume that any speaker whatsoever might not “inform” but rather “indoctrinate” before even having said their piece? Who are they to judge whose speech deserves to be heard and whose merits silencing? <br></p><p>During these pandemic-plagued times, digital communications are crucial to both the discussion of ideas and the organization of dissent. To resist corporations’ policing of internet-facilitated speech, we need to take immediate action — before the internet becomes a place where only certain opinions, and <a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/the-pulse/the-internet-splits-in-two"">certain ideologies</a>, are permitted. We the People must rise up and insist that technology companies step away from policing — that is, <em>restricting </em>— the freedom of speech and be held accountable for their infringement of that fundamental right. </p><p>Resist the tyranny of Big Tech.

Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center, who called the trend “devastating.” “These are just the ones that show up in the E.R.”<br>— <strong>from Time to Sound the Alarm Over Youth Suicides</strong>, <strong>by Jane E.

So why do we allow it? What is the attraction of it? I think that it’s the increase in control we get in return. Social media has enabled the Great Control Swap. And it is happening right now, beneath our notice. </p><p>The first baby step toward the Great Swap was the shift from phone calls to texts. A phone interaction requires participants to be “on the same time,” which entails negotiations over entrance into and exit from the conversation. Consider all the time we spend first on, “Is this a bad time to call? Can you talk?” And then later on, “O.K., gotta go, talk to you soon, see you later, good talking to you . . .” (It’s only in the movies that you can just hang up on someone.) Everyone has been in a phone conversation that ended much later than they wanted it to; the form subjects us to the will of another.<br>A text or email interaction, by contrast, liberates the parties so that each may operate on their own time. But the cost comes in another form of control: data. Homer’s “winged words” fly from the mouth of one directly to the ear of another, but text-based communication requires stationary words: One person puts them down, so the other can come along and read them at their leisure. And that means they leave a trail.<br>Imagine a man conducting a romantic affair exclusively by email. He needn’t lie to his wife about fake “business trips,” since he can pursue his shenanigans right under her nose.<br>Likewise, he avoids undesirable entanglements with his mistress: He doesn’t even need to buy her dinner! Email allows him the control to steer the two women out of the way of one another — but the price he pays is a very robust data trail. His affair has a text archive. If his mistress decides to write a book about it, she can be scientific. She needn’t rely on memory or vague impressions. She can systematically analyze their interactions and quote his exact words.<br>— <strong>from Agnes Callard</strong>,<strong><br></strong>The Real Cost of Tweeting About My Kids,<br>The New York Times</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0f5816e2475b54dd0a2896_5e69620fe285ba5ae26c7261_brush_divider_900x150.jpeg""></div></figure><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0f58e34b0203c59f7365ab_5e6963e9157c8c48386f00fa_chat_3_750x650.jpeg""></div></figure><p>Tallie Baram, a neurologist at the University of California, devised an experiment with baby rats. She wondered how it would affect them down the line if their mothers were constantly distracted.<br>One group of rats was raised in a cage without enough nesting material — so the moms were constantly running around looking for more bits of soft stuff instead of paying attention to their children. The control group got enough material in their cage to create a comfortable home — so those mother rats did attend properly for their pups.<br>The researchers monitored both groups of baby rats as they grew up.<br>By adolescence, a clear trend had emerged. Something had happened to the rats raised by distracted mothers. They showed less interest in food, explored less, played less, and were more listless than the control-group rats. (The results were published in Transactional Psychiatry.)<br>In a similar human experiment, psychologist Sarah Myruski and her team looked at the development of babies of moms who were constantly on the phone. The results, published in Developmental Science, confirmed the worst. Those neglected kids were distressed, less curious, and slower to recover their spark after mom tuned back in from cyberspace.

Among the NSA’s technological tools (some of which Snowden aided in perfecting), XKEYSCORE was, according to Snowden, “the most invasive . . . if only because [the NSA agents are] closest to the user — that is, the closest to the person being surveilled.” For nearly three hundred pages, the memoir has built to this scene, foreshadowed in the preface, in which the whistleblower-in-the-making sees behind the curtain:<br><br>I sat at a terminal from which I had practically unlimited access to the communications of nearly every man, woman, and child on Earth who’d ever dialed a phone or touched a computer. Among those people were about 320 million of my fellow American citizens, who in the regular conduct of their everyday lives were being surveilled in gross contravention of not just the Constitution of the United States, but the basic values of any free society.<br><br>The steady approach to Snowden’s come-to-Jesus encounter with XKEYSCORE is as meticulous as the incremental unveiling of the terror of Cthulhu in an H. P. Lovecraft tale. Snowden himself alludes to this parallel:<br><br>It was, simply put, the closest thing to science fiction I’ve ever seen in science fact: an interface that allows you to type in pretty much anyone’s address, telephone number, or IP address, and then basically go through the recent history of their online activity. In some cases you could even play back recordings of their online sessions, so that the screen you’d be looking at was their screen, whatever was on their desktop.<br><br>And: “It was like watching an autocomplete, as letters and words flashed across the screen. But the intelligence behind that typing wasn’t artificial but human: this was a humancomplete.” And:<br><br>One thing you come to understand very quickly while using XKEYSCORE is that nearly everyone in the world who’s online has at least two things in common: they have all watched porn at one time or another, and they all store photos and videos of their family. This was true for virtually everyone of every gender, ethnicity, race, and age — from the meanest terrorist to the nicest senior citizen.<br><br>— <strong>from Snowden in the Labyrinth,</strong><br>Jonathan Lethem, New York Review of Books</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0f5816e2475b54dd0a2896_5e69620fe285ba5ae26c7261_brush_divider_900x150.jpeg""></div></figure><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0f592d0f122d7da6b652e7_5e696764093c34327f63846d_chat_5_750x650.jpeg""></div></figure><p>The drones above us can be understood as harbingers of a total digital colonization that is already being undertaken by Silicon Valley through the ‘internet of things’ (a phrase connoting the absolute integration of our homes, vehicles, and infrastructure of our lives into one single network); ‘smart cities’ (the privatization of our cities’ infrastructure by Silicon Valley); social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram); Google transport innovations (drones, Tesla Motors), Big Data, total surveillance, AI, VR, and last but not least, ‘immortality’ (Silicon Valley’s dream that we will upload our brains and live for ever).

Breitbart News, the notorious mouthpiece of the alt-right, published an article that day under the headline “Michael Moore–backed ‘Planet of the Humans’ Takes Apart the Left’s Green Energy Scams.” The following day James Delingpole, who once wrote in <em>The Telegraph</em> that “it would be nice to think one day that there would be a Climate Nuremberg” for any and all “who talked up the global warming scare,” tweeted that Moore was his “new hero.” Marc Morano, who runs the denialist website ClimateDepot.org, deemed the film a “tour de force” in an interview with the Canadian far-right outfit Rebel News.

However, it should first be noted that Michael Moore served solely as the film’s executive producer, not as its director, writer, or star. Credit for those roles rightfully belongs to Jeff Gibbs, a producer of four of Moore’s documentaries including Bowling for <em>Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11.</em></p><p>Attributions aside, what has got both sides of the divide so worked up about <em>Planet of the Humans</em>? In the film, Gibbs attempts to expose the pernicious lie which, he alleges, underpins a half-century’s efforts to wean civilization off fossil fuels — that lie being the promise of renewable energy. “I’m in a strange position,” Gibbs grumbles. “I’m against our addiction to fossil fuels and have long been a fan of green energy. But everywhere I encountered green energy, it wasn’t what it seemed.” The viewer is led on a disillusioning journey in which such once-propitious sources of energy as wind, solar, and biomass are shown not only to be disappointing failures but, environmentally speaking, worse even than the filthy combustibles which they were supposed to replace. “You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels … </p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f6a63ec1a016c37ab89b119_poth5_ozzie_zehner_600x400.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p>instead of playing pretend,” asserts Ozzie Zehner, a co-producer of the film as well as its token green-energy “expert.” A wooded peak is razed to make way for wind turbines, apparently much in the fashion of mountaintop-removal coalmining. Hybrid cars are charged on an electrical grid supplied almost entirely by coal. Coal-fired power plants are shut down in the name of all things green, only for even larger natural-gas plants to take their place. Forests are cleared, their trees burnt up as “biomass.” Centuries-old Joshua trees are ground down to the earth to provide level terrain for an array of resource-intensive solar panels. Throughout, politicians and businessmen laud this duplicity as “progress,” while the undeceived but-powerless weep. Even more despairing, stalwarts of the environmental movement are themselves revealed to be these plunderers’ greedy, two-timing bedfellows — Faustian villains who have betrayed not only the hopes of their disciples but the planet itself.</p><p>Such a straightforward morality-tale might do well for Sunday school. Thinking adults, however, should know better than to believe it without scrutiny. Little wonder, then, that the dozens of “debunkings” of the film are preoccupied with correcting its catalogue of inaccuracies, exaggerations, misrepresentations, and falsehoods. “It’s true that the carbon footprint of renewable energy is not zero,” writes Yale Climate Connections’ Dana Nuccitelli. “But the film somehow fails to mention that it’s far lower than the fossil fuel alternatives, instead falsely suggesting (with zero supporting evidence) that renewables are just as bad.” Grist’s Shannon Osaka avers that Gibbs “overlooks substantive research, preferring to cherry-pick facts, make sweeping generalizations, and engineer ‘gotcha’ moments on camera.” Mark Diesendorf of the University of New South Wales judges the film’s take on renewables to be “out-of-date, superficial, simplistic and misleading.” On review of the evidence, these faultfinders appear justified in calling Gibbs out for arguing in bad faith. Each of the main charges against his argument — that it is outdated, misleading, and ignorant — are levelled on reasonable grounds.</p><p>For one, Gibbs attends the launch of the hybrid Chevrolet Volt. The year is 2010 (though not acknowledged in the film) and the place is Lansing, Michigan. An official representing the municipal utility discloses that the displayed Volts are charging on Lansing’s electrical grid, “which is about ninety-five percent coal,” and suggests that Gibbs check out the town’s “football field–size” solar array. There, another official explains that the efficiency of the panels that make up the array is a damning “eight percent … enough to meet the energy requirements of ten homes.” What he doesn’t mention is that the array dates from 2008. It may be true that, for a variety of reasons (not least of which is cost), old equipment often lurches on despite ongoing technical advances. But Lansing’s aged array is clearly not, as is implied in the movie, representative of the present state of solar technology. Nevertheless, “in every corner of the United States, driving an [electric vehicle] produces significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than cars powered only by gasoline,” writes <em>Forbes</em>’ Silvio Marcacci, “regardless of the local power mix.” Marcacci’s reporting draws on data, current as of 2018, provided by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Electric cars are evidently far from cure-all solutions to climate change. Yet Gibbs offers no stronger criticism to dispel such an illusion.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f6a60ef8cab194f854f4b54_poth3_cedar_street_solar_array_600x400.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p>Or take Gibbs’ probing of Daggett, California. Since 1984, several generations of solar arrays have skirted the dusty, nearly derelict town. But on their visit, “Ozzie and I discovered that the giant solar arrays” — that is, Solar Energy Generating System (SEGS) sites I and II — “had been razed to the ground,” leaving nothing but metal stumps in the sand. “It suddenly dawned on me what we were looking at,” Gibbs groans: “a solar dead zone.” Which may have been true sometime between 2014 and 2017, unveiling when the footage was shot. But afterwards, SEGS I and II were replaced respectively by Sunray 2 and 3, far more efficient photovoltaic arrays. (Together, they generated a combined “97,631 megawatt hours in 2018” — enough to “run a toaster for 9,288 years” — with “no site emissions” and “no water usage,” according to Joshi.) The audience is led to believe, falsely, that the sites have been abandoned to Ozymandian ruin.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f6a61f3ec3ebfa489642aca_poth4_daggett_california_600x400.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p>As a final example — though I could go on — the viewer is taken to the mist-shrouded summit of Lowell Mountain, Vermont. There, a righteous band of citizen-activists have gathered to survey a site cleared for the instillation of twenty-one wind turbines. The peak’s defoliation is equated with “mountaintop removal,” which EarthShare describes as “a surface mining practice that blows up mountaintops to expose coal seams.” On looking at photographs of the latter side-by-side with Lowell’s Kingdom Community Wind Farm (completed as of 2012), however, I am not convinced. The wholesale decimation inherent in mountaintop removal — that is, <em>blowing up mountains</em> — bears absolutely no comparison with Lowell’s still largely green hills. The suggestion that the two are in fact comparable is risible. But don’t take my word for it. Undertake the same investigation for yourself, if you care to.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f6a617b1514cb2dda1b2e57_poth4_wind_turbine_construction_site_600x400.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p>While Gibbs’ attempt to impugn wind and solar miscarries, what about his claims regarding environmental darlings Bill McKibben and the Sierra Club? Gibbs insists that both are beholden to corporate money. “The takeover of the environmental movement by capitalism is now complete,” he declares. “Environmentalists are no longer <em>resisting </em>those with the profit motive, but collaborating <em>with</em> them.” McKibben, for his part, admits on camera that 350.org received funding from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The source of the Rockefeller family’s copious wealth was Standard Oil, broken up in 1911 into thirty-four companies including Exxon and Mobil (later ExxonMobil). But the repent ant Brothers Fund, founded in 1940 by third-generation heirs to “advance social change that contributes to a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world,” is one of Big Oil’s most well-endowed foes. ExxonMobil sued the Rockefellers in 2016 for “conspiring” against the company by funding reportage that revealed its decades-long cover-up of oil’s environmental dangers. The Sierra Club, for its part, is shown to have accepted millions from billionaire (and foredoomed presidential candidate) Michael Bloomberg to pay for its “Beyond Coal” campaign, which aims “to close all coal plants in the U.S. and replace them entirely with sources of clean energy.” Despite Bloomberg’s supporting natural-gas fracking, the organization claims to have “shifted the narrative on fracked gas from a clean ‘bridge fuel’ to the truth that it’s a polluting fossil fuel like oil and coal” since it began its “Beyond Dirty Fuels” campaign in 2018. It would seem that the Sierra Club is <em>not</em> obligated, at least rhetorically, to serve Bloomberg’s business interests.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f6a600408d663708368cb5f_poth2_the_new_york_times_600x400.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><p>The point is not that Gibbs is unjustified in calling out renewables for their pitfalls, especially the truly irredeemable practice of clear-cutting for biomass. Nor is Gibbs wrong to hold to account those who, with palms greased, promote renewable energy as a miracle solution. But he undermines his own case by making it with so little integrity. An argument even in favour of something robustly true is nonetheless tainted, and made invalid, by its being argued dishonestly. If he cares enough to make his case on film, why would Gibbs not make use of more current and compelling evidence, rather than stoop to deceit? And after enduring the insult of being deceived, who stands to listen?</p><p>The answer to the first question is that Gibbs must both be intellectually lazy and hold an equally low estimation of his audience. The answer to the second, is the denialist cynics seeking to make an example of his apostasy. The latter are clearly no more wedded to the truth than is Gibbs, or else they are exactly the sort of dupes he hoped to fool. Yet whether he is averse to their backing, his film has proved opportune grist for their mill. It is precisely Gibbs’ and Moore’s “left-wing, activist background … which makes the movie’s message so much more compelling,” writes Delingpole for Breitbart. “It might even help Trump clinch the next presidential election, for it undermines the entire basis of the Green New Deal being pushed in one form or another by his opponents.” That is doubtful, though the message is plain. Moore, for his part, seems an outright hypocrite after having enthusiastically endorsed Bernie Sanders, one of the Green New Deal’s most prominent spokesmen.</p><p>What can redeem <em>Planet of the Humans</em>? Gibbs is right to question the extent to which environmentalist rhetoric, environmentalist causes, and the fallacy of a technological cure-all have been co-opted by moneyed interests. Everywhere money lurks, and especially where there are anxieties to exploit, there ought to be vigilance. If environmentalists are too busy with making a profit to properly attend to climate change then they deserve to be admonished, and support for them should be directed elsewhere. But to the detriment of his argument, Gibbs distracts himself with shooing off yesteryear’s ghosts, meanwhile scarcely taking stock of<em> today’s</em> crop of environmentalists and refusing to suggest a way forward.</p><p>Actually, that’s not quite right. He does indicate what, he believes, lies at the heart of the problem. And he hints at what might be done to address it. The problem, articulated by a handful of interviewees, is overconsumption abetted by overpopulation. “Right now,” says anthropologist Steven Churchill, too large a percent age of the population “is supported by industrial agriculture, which is heavily subsidized by oil. And it’s not sustainable … Without seeing some sort of major die-off in population, there’s no turning back.” The solution is — well, you fill in the blank. Do Gibbs or Churchill or any other interviewee indicate what might be done to remedy the ills of oil-subsidized industrial agriculture, in order to avoid such a die-off? No. So, who is to go first? Wealthy, white Westerners consume and pollute the most per-capita. But, as Gibbs stops short of saying, the brown and poor people of the Earth (many soon to become “climate refugees”) are far more numerous — and they multiply much more rapidly. Take the insinuation to its logical conclusion and determine for yourself how you would feel living in Gibbs’ vision of the future.</p><p>The past, where Gibbs situates himself in this film, offers many useful lessons but little in the way of predictive power. That was then, this is now, and a lot has changed in the meantime. Attitudes towards climate change — which many now tellingly call the climate <em>crisis</em> — are on one hand more obstinate, and on the other more impatient. The Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and abrogated numerous environmental-protection laws. Extinction Rebellion (XR) has been at it for two years, Greta Thunberg roughly as long. September of last year saw the largest climate-related protests in history, with millions striking worldwide in solidarity with Thunberg’s “Fridays for Future.” In many places, McKibben’s 350.org carried out much of the strikes’ organizing. It is not yet obvious what they achieved, though they did reveal who is most urgently concerned with the shape of things to come. Schoolchildren, galvanized by the threat of a disaster-riddled future, showed up in unprecedented droves. What does Gibbs have to offer them? Little more than a shrug. In his eyes, they missed the point. They should never have been born to begin with.</p><p>The environmental movement now finds itself a half-century beyond the first Earth Day, and nearly 60 years past the publication of<em> Silent Spring</em>. Has it lost its way? Are its long-cherished institutions bound too closely to the incentives of capitalism? It may have. It may be. But neither conclusion can be drawn from <em>Planet of the Humans</em> without the taint of untruth. In any case, a new generation of climate activists has already emerged. And its members — supporters of the likes of XR, Thunberg, and the Sunrise Movement — don’t buy the illusion that renewables alone, without a broad reconsideration of the political-economic status quo, can save humanity from the worst effects of climate change. “Decades of institutional failure ensures that only ‘unrealistic’ proposals … now have a realistic chance of stopping the planetary death spiral,” writes journalist George Monbiot. “And only those who stand outside the failed institutions,” like XR’s self-styled rebels, “can lead this effort.” At the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, Thunberg inveighed against world leaders: “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” The Sunrise Movement, in its own words, is “building an army of young people to break the hold of oil and gas CEOs on our politics and elect leaders who will protect the health and wellbeing of all people, not just a wealthy few.” Irrespective of <em>Planet of the Humans</em>, a new wave of environmentalists has already arrived, and its young proponents have no hang-ups about getting political. Why should they? After all, they were born into a world in flames. And unlike some of their benumbed elders, they can feel the heat.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f69195e63750f6b63ae7eb3_the_end_is_near_600x400.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f6a5f5208d663468168c908_planet_of_the_humans_title_600x400.jpg,"Earth Day’s fiftieth anniversary, which fell on April 22, marked a strange celebration for climate-change deniers.

These promoted freedom of thought and expression, of religion, of movement and association and of sexual orientation, whereby ‘any particular freedom is to be respected only insofar as it does not violate the equal freedom of others.’ Within a liberal international order, such ‘rule by the people’ encompassed freedom of political participation, representation, expression and association. It also included having regular free, inclusive and equal elections, the presence of accountable and transparent political institutions to guarantee the individual liberties and rights of citizens, and access to competing information. At its core, the US endorsed electoral democracy as the central and unquestionable pillar of its preferred international order. Such social and political rights are seen as being generalizable to the internal basis of all countries, and hence the whole international system. They also produced a sense of solidarity among Western countries concerning the preservation of a common social and political basis. </p><p id="""">For the economic realm, and as the world’s dominant power after 1945, the US arranged the world economy in line with its broader security and political interests. After the Second World War, economic growth and trade liberalization went hand in hand with the creation of modern social democracy, whereby economic prosperity would enhance individual social and political — especially democratic — rights. Economic liberalism thus upholds ‘the rights of individuals to make any choices they please in the exercise of their labour and the use of their wealth and income, so long as they respect the liberty, property and contractual rights of others.’ Key to this vision were open global markets and free trade practices enshrined by anti-protectionist institutions through the rule of law. Such a basis married with a focus on cooperation, shared gains and interdependence, backed up by domestic welfare states. Underpinning this system was the US dollar as the premier international currency, with access to the US market and technology provided to countries that would be reliable partners and allies. Through the Washington Consensus, first posited in 1989 (and investigated further in Chapter 3), these ideas metamorphosized into the mantra of neoliberalism, which promoted free-market capitalism via policies that included privatization, deregulation and globalization, as well as lower government spending and austerity. </p><p id="""">The final realm of the US-dominated liberal order rests on the use of force as a means to stabilize and strengthen its desired international order, with military intervention being regarded as necessary to protect and enforce liberal democracy and human rights. In this way, the 1950-53 Korean War sought ‘to establish the rule of law in the world’, while the 1955-75 Vietnam War aimed to ‘defend the frontiers of freedom’. Defence planners also saw military power as vital to securing global markets and resources via the threat or use of military force, as well as a worldwide alliance system between the US and its regional partners, built on institutions and formal agreements. The US’s 800 military bases across 80 countries (versus 70 held by all other countries) underscores the centrality of military force to its international order, and its use to promote its goals, values and interests, whereby, as a former US president noted, if you ‘speak softly and carry a big stick, you will go far’. Compounding this importance, many of these bases were also established following demands by US allies for protection and deterrence against aggression. Military power has thus been used to strengthen the other realms of the US-led liberal international order, making ‘access to resources and markets, socioeconomic stability, political pluralism, and American security interests — all . . . inextricably linked’.</p><h2 id="""">Dominance, Hubris, and China's Challenge</h2><p id="""">The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War signalled the zenith of the US-led international order, which was unchallenged at the close of the 20th century. American thinkers proclaimed the irresistible triumph of the West’s liberal international order as marking ‘the end of history’ — that is, ‘the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government’. Moreover, with its main strategic competitor sidelined, and a dearth of viable alternatives, the liberal hegemony narrative presumed that rising powers such as China could be co- opted into the US-led international order. Such dominance led to an unashamed dawning of Pax Americana, with observers arguing ‘Why deny it? Why be embarrassed by it?’ Notably, these claims entailed elements of myth and presumption, as not all the world — including China, India, the former Soviet bloc, much of the Islamic world and many developing countries — had been subsumed into such a concept. This divergence indicated that the Western order was pre-eminent but not omnipotent and was thus a dominant international order but not necessarily a sweeping world order. It also overlooked the US’s periodic support of various authoritarian regimes (such as in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Iran), and its overthrow of democratic regimes (across South America, for example). </p><p id="""">As the 21st century began, the liberal international order experienced three major crises that called into question its global legitimacy and reputation. The first of these came after 9/11 and the subsequent invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the resultant long period of occupation, instability and widespread deaths, which effectively undercut the acceptability of deploying overwhelming force in geopolitics. The use of torture, clandestine jails (known as ‘black sites’), and rendition, as well as the pursuit of nebulous political reforms, further questioned the validity of the military, social and political pillars of the US-led liberal international order. Washington’s departure from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, which led to the rapid political return of the Taliban — whose removal had been cited as the major aim of the US’s 2001 invasion, and who re- took the country in weeks — further undercuts this legitimacy and in many ways signalled the death of ‘liberal military interventionalism’. In turn, the 2008 credit crisis served to challenge the core rationales of the Western-based international financial system, and hence the liberal economic pillar of the current international order. Going further still, the current coronavirus pandemic which began in 2020 has also revealed the seeming inability of the US (and other Western states) to comprehensively protect the wellbeing and security of their citizens. It also asked if the privileging of individual rights is the best basis for a society versus protecting the collective health of a population as a whole (as has been the norm for many other countries, especially in China and across East Asia). </p><p id="""">As the credibility of the Western liberal international order has been called into question, the rise of China has presented a clear challenge to it — and an alternative vision of international order. Socially and politically, China bears the hallmarks of an authoritarian system as it inhibits political pluralism, sanctions political participation, imprisons opponents, and uses state apparatuses to monitor, control and command the population. In turn, the country’s slow embrace of liberal economics — but merged with state control and a blurring between public and private ownership — has resulted in an economic system defined as being authoritarian-capitalist. China’s creation of different multilateral regimes, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), also act as mechanisms to further project China’s values into the global system. Together, these elements have produced a social, political and economic basis that contrasts to the core dynamics of the current liberal international order. They also act as an inspirational and non- ideological developmental model for other countries to follow, and by extension are engendering a new — China-inspired — illiberal world order.</p><h2 id="""">World leaders are flocking to China just like they flocked to Germany 80 years ago</h2><p id="""">Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden heralded a return to politics as normal in the US. The defeat did not ‘remove the threats and social changes that trigger the “action side” of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there . . . [and] will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desired.’</p><p id=""""> When this observation is combined with a Republican Party that refuses to accept the result of the 2020 election and continues to advocate for voter repression as well as attacking the media and academia, the spectre of another election victory by Trump or a Trump-esque successor is highly possible. More tellingly, either eventuality could result in a more experienced, better organized and more ideologically driven Republican leader, who as president would rule as a competent demagogue who quickly and irrevocably disassembles the pillars of US democracy. </p><p id="""">Such a leader would govern not via rule of law but by rule of law, would seek to eliminate the plurality of US policies, jail all political opponents and dismantle the universal human rights essential in a correctly functioning and accountability-inducing civil society. In particular, if Trump were to return as president in 2024, we can expect such a dismantling to be extremely rapid, and to be driven by a deep-seated vengeance against any and all of his political and media opponents. From this basis, it is entirely conceivable that American democracy could collapse by 2028, heralding a populist autocratic regime and potentially resulting in a wider civil war. As a leading civil rights activist said of Trump, ‘He’s willing to kill democracy. ... He is willing to kill America’s international and global relationships. He is a destroyer.’ If a similar leader were to emerge, and an authoritarian (even fascist) US to emerge, then a new authoritarian international order would also be swiftly confirmed along with a China-inspired authoritarian century. At the time of writing (in April 2022), the Democrats’ wafer-thin majorities in the Senate and the House provide little succour that such unwelcome eventualities will be avoided.</p><h2 id="""">Global panopticon</h2><p id="""">The major unifying factor between authoritarianism in China and that being increasingly manifest in other countries across the world is the use of increasingly powerful surveillance technology. Driven by Big Tech and advances in AI, they are fusing together the social and economic lives of the world’s population with authoritarian and outlooks centered on monitoring, manipulation and control. At the forefront of this fusing are social media companies whose interest in market share, data harvesting and acquiring content are increasingly surmounting political and moral considerations. </p><p id="""">First among them is Facebook, which in 2019 exempted political advertisements from a ban on making false claims, and which along with Twitter and Google allow the propagation of extremism and misinformation — including the glorification of violence during the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021. Such actions by Facebook have, for example, subverted freedoms of expression and speech in Vietnam and Thailand, and have enabled authoritarian regimes to attack civil rights activists and political opponents, as well as to incite violence in Myanmar, whereby Facebook ‘follow[s] state-sponsored censorship so that it can conduct operations, businesses and sales in that country.’ Collectively, these authoritarian practices influence billions of daily social media users across the world, which in April 2021 included 2.797 billion on Facebook, 2.291 billion on YouTube, 2 billion on WhatsApp, 1.287 billion on Instagram, 1.225 billion on Weixin and WeChat, 0.732 billion on TikTok and 0.600 billion on Douyin, among others. The neoliberal business practices of Big Tech are also anti-pluralistic — and hence authoritarian — as they protect their monopolies by buying up smaller companies, and from 2005 to 2020 Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Facebook were all prolific in this regard as they reportedly acquired 385 other US companies between them. </p><p id="""">Such capabilities are backed up by increasing political sway in the West. Big Tech firms are now among the biggest corporate donors in the US, outstripping Big Pharma, Big Tobacco and the arms industry. In 2020, Amazon and Facebook also spent nearly twice as much as Exxon and Phillip Morris on lobbying, had the highest number of lobbyists and spent $124 million in lobbying and campaign contributions during the 2020 presidential election. All of these elements point to these companies’ increasing supranational influence that is able to shape global politics and opinion, and which aims to permanently cement the presence of Big Tech into the political, social and economic fabric of the world. </p><p id="""">Their actions are also reflective of the key themes relating to international order in this book, in that they are actively facilitating, assimilating and normalizing authoritarian tendencies. In these dynamics, their owners possess incredible power, whereby, for example, Mark Zuckerberg ‘alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their news feeds, what privacy settings they can use ... he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.’ Such control over vast swathes of the global population points to a future wherein the power of Big Tech exceeds that of most — if not all — countries, especially if it its intertwined with the maintenance of authoritarian- oriented regimes. In 2005, Zuckerberg pertinently noted a preference for ‘companies over countries’, and in 2004 called users ‘dumb fucks’ for trusting him with their data. With ever cheaper and more advanced technology, and more countries like China and Russia willing to use it to watch and control their populations, Edward Snowden noted in 2015 that ‘if we do nothing, we ... sleepwalk into a total surveillance state where we have both a super-state that has unlimited capacity to apply force with an unlimited ability to know [about the people it is targeting], ... that’s a dark future.’ Such a future would be unrelentingly authoritarian and would confirm the authoritarian international order, both economically as enabled by Big Tech and politically when such technology is widely used. With Beijing as its key harbinger, it would also consecrate a China-inspired authoritarian century and international order.</p><h2 id="""">Descent, resistance, and re-learning</h2><p id="""">As H.G. Wells noted in another era, ‘There will be no day of days when a new world order comes into being. Step by step and here and there it will arrive . . . .’ In this way, and as this book has consistently evidenced, we are now on the cusp of — if not already descending into — an authoritarian international order. When we recall that this shift is occurring not just in China and like-minded autocracies but also across the world’s largest and most powerful democracies, the prognosis is astonishingly bleak. Such a scenario is reinforced by the prevalence of social media and technology that have become omnipresent surveillance tools across the world’s population and which globally magnify — frequently hate-filed and divisive — authoritarian desires. Set against a neoliberal background, the logic and attraction of such inclinations has never been higher and, as shown by hyper-crises such as COVID-19, are proving irresistable — even necessary — to many of our leaders, be they in autocracies or democracies. </p><p id="""">In terms of resisting the world’s wholesale descent into authoritarianism — a descent which would be exponentially difficult, if not impossible, to extricate ourselves from — what is therefore needed is the maintenance and protection of democratic practices and values. Part of this process requires countries to confront China concerning its own authoritarian practices, but also involves nurturing democratic ones at home and making them attractive for other countries to work with and to imitate. As former US President Barack Obama has argued, in democracy, ‘there has to be citizens who insist on it and participate to make sure it happens. Democracy is a garden that has to be tended.’ Such cultivation not only requires dissuading policies and political entities that are authoritarian or proto-authoritarian but also making sure that all individuals and groups embrace and respect key liberal norms. We must also remind ourselves that, in the words of John Buchan, democracy is ‘primarily an attitude of mind, a spiritual testament, and not an economic structure or a political machine.’ </p><p id="""">As such, liberal democratic societies ‘require more than the formal institutions of democracy. They also depend on a broad and deep commitment to the underlying values of a liberal society, most notably tolerance.’ In order to prevent any slippage towards authoritarianism, national political, social and moral values require regular maintenance. Populations need to be actively (and regularly) informed through publicity campaigns and mandatory ongoing civic education classes (for both children and adults) of their rights, and how such rights were originally won historically. Influential individuals — such as television producers, directors, authors, artists, musicians, teachers, journalists and any kind of elected official — need to pre-emptively use their positions now to insist on the production and promotion of such educational campaigns. Without a knowledge basis concerning what democracy is, citizens will be ever-more vulnerable to alternative narratives, especially in periods of tumult — in the form of profound social or economic shocks and depressions — that frequently only serve to further accentuate and speed up a country’s assimilation to authoritarianism and populism. We must also remember that with enough time, and as in modern China, any dissenting voices will be targeted by a control-hungry authoritarian regime and thus we all need to take action regardless of our political beliefs. Such action is necessary against any democratic backsliding, so as to maintain all democratic systems to the very highest standards. </p><p id="""">Most fundamentally of all, what this bolstering requires are virtuous leaders who reject intolerance, division and self-interest and who can focus our national energies to create positive change that celebrates and augments liberal democratic politics. These leaders must also help us ‘to re-learn the tools of reason, logic, clarity, dissent, civility, and debate ... those things [which] are the non-partisan basis of democracy. ... without them you can kiss this thing goodbye.’ Deprived of such leaders — and without such re-learning and individuals actively facilitating it — our global autocratic descent and the dawn of a new Pax Autocratica may well be irrevocably complete. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6494aa72d9025eaac066a893_democracy%20vs%20autocracy.png,"The UN’s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the liberal international order sought to guarantee rights on an individual level.

Last month, the far-right blog The Gateway Pundit <a href=""https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/08/democrat-supported-marxist-group-plans-siege-white-house-starting-september-17-50-days-2020-election/"">posted an article</a> about the WHS under the headline “Democrat Supported Marxist Group Plans Siege on White House,” etc. Titular “pundit” Jim Hoft failed to note that we are not in affiliated with, or supported by, any political group whatsoever. Neither are we a “Marxist group.” Without getting past the headline, Hoft has already lied to you twice. <br></p><p>Fringe outfit Big League Politics also <a href=""https://bigleaguepolitics.com/facebook-allows-antifa-style-group-to-organize-a-white-house-siege-on-their-platform/"">published a WHS-themed article</a>, in which author Shane Trejo alleged that “Facebook is allowing an ANTIFA-style group to organize a potentially violent ‘White House siege’ next month on their platform.” As a not-for-profit foundation and magazine publisher, we bear no resemblance, nor any connection, to Antifa. And Trejo’s intimation of violence, at least on our part, is a fabrication. If any violence does take place, it is only likely to be waged by the zealous thugs who read his thought-polluting drivel. <br></p><p>Trejo also wailed that “[g]roups like Adbusters need to be targeted under federal RICO laws or under the federal War on Terror.” (No law known as “the federal War on Terror” exists.) “These domestic enemies are far more dangerous to the U.S. Republic than ISIS could ever hope to be.” Leave aside the fatuous comparison with ISIS, which would be laughable if it weren’t so repulsively trivializing. Unlike <a href=""https://www.eagleobserver.com/news/2020/aug/26/the-white-house-siege-occupation-starts-sept-17/"">one of his peers</a>, Trejo neglected to disclose that we are Canadian (knowledge that can be gleaned from a quick <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/134479?hl=en"">Google search</a>) and therefore not “domestic” in the sense which he intended. Nor does it bear mentioning that the <a href=""https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/"">First Amendment</a> protects the freedom of assembly. Nothing about the WHS is remotely illegal. And yet one wonders whether Trejo’s bloodthirsty fearmongering and patent dishonesty are not the greater dangers to the Republic, founded as it was on “<a href=""https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/"">these truths</a>.” <br></p><p>Which brings us to the main course. Last weekend, the staunchly Trump-aligned cable channel One America News Network twice aired a one-hour “investigation” hosted by anchor-provocateur Jack Posobiec — known for little besides having peddled the “Pizzagate” hoax. “Throughout summer of 2020, violent riots and anarchism have spread across America’s cities,” Posobiec drones in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=VVs3OrA5B0o"">trailer</a> for the special, which is titled “September Siege – ANTIFA’s Plan to Occupy the White House.” (Yet more tiresome <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/us-rightwing-extremists-attacks-deaths-database-leftwing-antifa"">Antifa-baiting</a>.) “But there is a deeper plan at play here: a plan to lay siege to the White House, starting this September.” <br></p><p>Prosobiec, who has based the entirety of his regrettable livelihood on deceit, did inadvertently get one thing halfway right. A wave of violence has indeed recently spread across the United States. According to <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/804616715/fbi-announces-that-racist-violence-is-now-equal-priority-to-foreign-terrorism"">the FBI’s director, Chris Wray</a>, the agency has “elevated to the top-level priority racially motivated violent extremism” — “deadly attacks targeting Latinos, Jews and other minority groups” — “so it’s on the same footing in terms of our national threat banding as ISIS.” (Eat your words, Trejo.) In May, <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blame-abc-news-finds-17-cases-invoking-trump/story?id=58912889"">ABC News found</a> “54 cases invoking ‘Trump’ in connection with violence, threats, alleged assaults.” We challenge anyone to find evidence of similar cases involving names such as Biden. </p><p>We, on the other hand, are <a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/whitehousesiege-tactical-briefing-2"">calling</a> for the peaceable gathering of “thousands … to remind this authoritarian regime” of the American people’s “significance,” “will,” and “power.” <a href=""https://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/whitehousesiege-tactical-briefing-2"">In our eyes</a>, the “survival of the American experiment — the American <em>spirit </em>— requires nothing less” than a mass display of resistance to the debasement of its <a href=""https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/"">founding principles</a>. “We the People,” the Constitution’s framers wrote, seek to “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility,” to “promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.” We stand for justice, tranquility, general welfare, liberty — and truth. By spewing outright falsehoods, celebrating ignorance, and encouraging the violent suppression of avowedly non-violent protests, the feral fanatics of the American far-right have shown that they stand for exactly the opposite. They, not we, are the true enemies of the United States.</p><blockquote><em>Postscript, 14 September 2020.

Our mental, if not physical, environments are surrounded and suffused with violence. And while we may wish to escape its real effects, we cannot help but find it bewitching, seductive, even intoxicating. That is, lest we get too close.<br><br>Violence holds such sway over us because of its <strong>power to compel</strong>. It has the power to level and destroy, to bend and coerce, to persecute and punish, to shock and <strong>terrorize</strong>. It can move and efface borders, decimate and enslave peoples, engender suffering and extinguish traditions. Its lash can produce, like an inherited wound, <strong>pain lasting generations</strong> innocent of the initial lick. Simply to be a witness to violence can be enough to maim the mind beyond hope of its mending.</p><p><strong>What circumstances justify violence, if any?</strong> Violence never justifies itself. Nor should it be deemed a fitting response, except in the direst circumstances; and then only as a last resort. But there are <strong>two cases</strong> in which violence (where proportionate) is plausibly warranted: one that is nearly indisputable; another that may be more doubtful. The first is in case of <strong>self-defence</strong>; the second, <strong>revolution</strong>.<br>‍<br>The institutions and customs that human beings create for themselves naturally deteriorate, or descend into stagnancy, or become corrupt in time. Not infrequently, they are made corrupt by design.

Violence, in the form of warfare, may seem the natural answer. Yet, on occasion, solutions (nominally) barring violence have been known to achieve radical outcomes.<br><br>Perhaps most remarkable to popular memory, a British-educated Indian lawyer by the name of Mohandas Karamchand <strong>Gandhi</strong> led (less officially than symbolically) his nation from colonial rule to independence by means of non-violent disobedience. Putting theories of peaceful resistance — developed from an eclectic mixture of religious teachings, and with the influence of Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, and others — into practice, Gandhi helped to achieve for his country what his more violence-prone countrymen could not for nearly a century. But with all due historical poignancy, Gandhi’s life ended, after almost eight decades, due to a bullet-wound in his chest. At the time of his assassination, India had enjoyed independence for less than six months.<br><br>Next to Gandhi’s, by dint of historical succession, is the example of Rev. <strong>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr</strong>. Carried out with enduring, ennobling oratory, King’s leadership of the Civil Rights Movement, and his non-violent advocacy for the dignity and equality of African Americans, earned him a Nobel Peace Prize — and the ire of white supremacists. Short of forty years, King’s life ended on a hotel balcony when a round fired from a racist’s rifle ripped through his head.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0774566e20689be34c5ca4_martin_luther_king_1000x563.jpg""></div></figure><p>Following Gandhi and King, the fight for colonial emancipation and racial justice had its next great hero in <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong>. Though a revolutionary socialist and disciple of the politics of violence when young, he later embraced the example of his non-violent predecessors, ending therewith a half-century of apartheid in South Africa. He died, like King, a Nobel laureate, at the venerable age of ninety-five, of natural causes.<br><br>Yet for all the mythologizing and saint-making of the likes of Gandhi, King, and Mandela, beneath their dazzling iconography lies a more tangled truth. For even their efforts, though noble, were not entirely without debt to actors more viciously disposed. India’s freedom from imperial fetters was not achieved solely through the peaceable shaming of its imperial oppressors. (It was thankful that they could be shamed at all. Think of what might have befallen efforts at peaceful resistance within, say, Stalin’s or Hitler’s contemporaneous empires, and shudder.) Civil Rights were not won in the United States without well-founded fears of violent reprisal. The fall of apartheid came only after decades of both <strong>non-violent protest</strong> and <strong>guerilla resistance</strong>. These causes, despite their formidable pacifist legacies, had political purchase based on both violent and non-violent initiatives. Nor can these peaceful resistance movements be divorced entirely from the violence to which they gave way. Look at these three countries today and see whether grounds for violence do not persist despite Gandhi’s, King’s, and Mandela’s laudable deeds.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f07746b9cdcfb80b2493657_mandela_1000x563.jpg""></div></figure><p>If the <strong>idea of revolutionary</strong> change arising purely from <strong>peaceful disobedience</strong> is but a dream, who is to say that violence is not justified to achieve radical ends?

But many, too, have seen <strong>violence</strong> go <strong>beyond</strong> its intended <strong>bounds</strong> of restraint, and usurp a righteous cause with a vengeful creed all its own. The great fear must be that opportunities sprung in the name of justice risk being commandeered by sordid interests, or else subject to the corruption born of violence itself. This risk must be carefully minded in the course of every <strong>violent revolution</strong>. Each in time may have its own would-be Napoleon; each storming of the Bastille, its Terror; each Lafayette, its Robespierre; each philosophical Marx, its overweening Stalin.

The realm of ideas is where revolutions endure as affirmations of humanity’s compassion for its best parts, and of its desire to humbly improve the world in which it finds itself living. Violence alone does not make for lasting political power. <strong>James Madison</strong> claimed that all political authority is based on popular assent — <strong>“that all governments rest on opinion.”</strong> It is in revolutions’ appeal to that all-important arbiter — the opinion, the ideals, the beliefs of the many — that they gain traction: as forces of change for today, for tomorrow, and (it must sometimes be admitted) for far-off, distant days better suited to take up today’s precocious aims.<br><br>Out of revolutions may come, to borrow from a tale of two sympathies, the best or worst of times, ages of wisdom or foolishness, seasons of light or darkness, springs of hope, or winters of despair. Yet so may these mixed outcomes arise even in the absence of revolution. Misery needs no pretext to wreak its worst; tyranny, no special moment. It is seldom easy to judge whether the unacknowledged suffering, or the suffering that revolutionary violence can precipitate, exacts the greatest toll. <strong>“The Tsarist oppression was severe. The Tsarist regime was unjust. The [Russian] Revolution was because of very good reasons. And,”</strong> said historian Stephen Kotkin (biographer of Stalin, himself no proponent of the Soviet era, and certainly no apologist for Stalinist excesses), <strong>“thank God they overthrew the Tsarist regime.”</strong> Though, for all this, the <strong>“shards of the old regime [became] the building blocks of the new regime.”</strong> May this last serve as an enduring lesson and warning for all revolutions to come.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0777478a890bbabfde7284_saudi_arabia_1000x563.jpg""></div></figure><p>As for revolutions to come.

The <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong> had been published in the month of February; peasants and workers and bourgeois alike were beginning to agitate; socialism and communism and representative democracy were the radical causes du jour. The upheaval spread, in shapes softened by distance, as far abroad as South America; and into the future, where, as an idea, an example, and an admonition, it persisted despite (or perhaps, rather, because of) its failures. Then, on to <strong>1917</strong>; and to <strong>1968</strong>; and to <strong>1989</strong>; and to <strong>2011</strong>.

Today, the value of outstanding “over the counter” derivatives contracts (private futures, options, and swap agreements not made on recognized exchanges) dwarfs the entire world’s GDP, and the volume of annually traded OTC derivatives (which may change hands multiple times a minute) dwarfs even that figure. For Randy Martin, author of Knowledge LTD, the derivative not only names a particular set of financial instruments, it identifies a methodological tendency in capitalism. New technological and mathematical instruments have emerged that allow derivatives to be priced and exchanged as their own financial assets. Derivatives can be built atop one another in a portfolio, creating a complex cascade of mutually reinforcing or cantilevered speculations. They can be aggregated into complex synthetic derivatives or sliced and diced into new cuts of financial meat to suit the taste of a variety of clients. These promissory notes become the bedrock of a new financial system that is increasingly distant from providing the insurance and security for our hypothetical baker and more about a constant drive toward securitization, a felicitious financial term that means the splitting apart and re-bundling of assets to create new securities — as when banks deaggregated and re-aggregated subprime and other loans into the infamous mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) they sold-on to their clients as risk-free investments.</p><p>By contrast, the advent of the modern derivative, and the broader shift toward financialization it portends, marks a shift in this logic. The circulation of money appears to become an end into itself. Financialized speculation ultimately seeks to generate wealth external to any necessary change in the underlying capitalist economy.

Gen Z led the charge. The children of Occupy Wall Street — footsoldiers of the Third Force — went full Johnny Paycheck on their crappy minimum-wage employment.</p><p>“This is a fight response,” a career coach told The New York Times. When people are triggered, they go reptilian: fight or flight. And flight’s not an option when you’re cornered. Across a scorched-earth economic landscape employees looked their bosses in the eye, and their bosses blinked. Because the power dynamic was reversed and everyone knew it. For once it was the workers who had the leverage.</p><p>“We are short-staffed. Please be patient with the staff that did show up. Nobody wants to work anymore.”</p><p>That sign on a McDonald’s drive-through this spring was revolutionary tinder. That last sentence in particular — a noisy blurb by some manager pissed off by the coddled youth and their lack of stick-to-itiveness — did exactly the opposite of what was intended. Instead of sympathy for the management class, it inspired a wave of parodies. And then the former US labor secretary Robert Reich called BS with a definitive series of tweets: “Let’s get one thing straight: there is no labor shortage. There is a shortage of employers willing to pay their workers a living wage. Instead of: no one wants to work anymore. Try: no one wants to be exploited anymore.”</p><p>The way people were quitting — trumpeting their departures on social media — should have been a clue that this wasn’t about laziness. It’s the opposite of lazy to quit out loud. That is fury talking. It’s a statement that this is not about me. Something much bigger is happening, something historic — a convergence of at least five human-made crises — and I’ll be damned if I’m going to miss the chance to be part of it.</p><p>But here’s the curious and kind of wonderful thing about this fight: the lack of blood on the streets. This is a new kind of resistance, more Gandhi than Robespierre. No blades, no bullhorns, no threats. It’s more like a martial art: you absorb the violence of your aggressor without having to be violent yourself. In fact, this may be the apex of the art: simply climbing into bed and pulling the covers over your head.</p><p>The Mandarin word for it is “tang ping” — literally “lying flat.” Young Chinese, beaten down by an authoritarian system and yearning to live a more relaxed life, spread themselves against the earth like a measuring tape, becoming “the metric of all things,” as one protester put it in a social media post that was quickly deleted by the state. Clearly, the pushback against degrading overwork is not just a Western thing. Rather, it’s a sign, as one tang ping enthusiast put it, of a “global unraveling.”</p><p>*</p><p>“I opt out.” Those are powerful words. Consider the mighty, status-quo-toppling impact of this passive gesture if everybody did it. The new activists have found magic in inverting the old mantra of the capitalist hustle.</p><p>Don’t just do something: stand there.</p><p>To do nothing, even for a short while, is an active rebuke of the creation of capitalist value. You’ve re-routed your attention from the distraction economy (which always ends up with you buying something, usually online) into something dreamier and more exploratory, which might ultimately compel you, when you do get up from your prone position, to lace up your shoes and walk right past the car in the driveway and continue on, just walking, beyond where the sidewalk ends.</p><p>And this has been the one upside of the otherwise grim blight on the world that is this pandemic: the disruption gave everyone time to reflect on their workaday routine. And a lot of people came to the same conclusion: Why the fuck should I take the prime of my life and simply hand it over? I could get breakthrough Covid and die. I could get Long Covid and be forever compromised. These could be my last good days, and I will never get them back.</p><p>So you stand down and take a breath. And survey the landscape. And you realize that what you’ve been doing so doggedly, committing to so loyally, giving the best of your energies to, is what David Graeber called a “bullshit job.” In the eyes of the corporate vassal who signs your cheques, you are fungible, interchangeable — meaning you have no particular value, and nothing you’re doing has any lasting value, except to shareholders (of which you are not one). And that’s when you raise the white flag. Because a totally predictable sequence of events happens when you strip people of their dignity: they get depressed. And then they get mad.</p><p>And then they get even.</p><p>To be crystal clear here, this is not about not wanting to work. We humans are working dogs. We prefer to work than not to work, studies show. Graeber liked to point out that in prisons, they use withdrawing your work privileges as punishment. “Given a choice between sitting around playing cards and pressing shorts, prisoners will take the latter.” But prison work isn’t exactly what most people are thrilled to do voluntarily. And, increasingly, that’s the kind of work most of the world’s workers are faced with.</p><p>The economist David Spencer, in his new book Making Light Work, rejects the idea that only a small minority get the privilege of doing high-quality work, while the rest of us press shorts. There are ways to reconfigure working life starting with a shorter work week — that can restore some of the creativity and dignity and meaning to the work most of us do.</p><p>And the average employee comes to understand: You do not own me, day and night. I give my service to you, on my terms. </p><p>So celebrate this moment of opportunity born of crisis. Maybe these are the first growing-pain heaves along the road to what a new definition of a successful life actually looks like.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/62266db561ca2a734c20695e_didnt_go_to_work_600x413.gif,Americans quit their jobs this summer at rate never seen before.

This question might mean different things to, say, a teen-ager, yearning for excitement; or to a middle-aged man, driving a Porsche, groping towards some long-elusive “purpose.” But in the context of the abortion debate, this question takes on a greater weight. When does life begin? When does the union of two cells, one maternal and one paternal, become one human being? How can the inception of human life, the moment of miraculous awakening, be measured?<br><br>For many supporters of the pro-life movement, the answer is simple and decisive: life begins with a heartbeat. (The heart is the first organ to develop in utero; it begins beating spontaneously around 21 or 22 days after conception.) Anti-abortion adherents believe that an embryo is no longer a mass of unconscious cells, but a human being, at the moment its pulse is detected. This claim is loosely philosophical, but its striking emotional resonance is compelling. For some, it is a spiritual proposition. And from the pro-life perspective, a foetus is a person from that moment onward; as such, it has a right to life.<br><br>On the other side of the debate, this reasoning tends to be carefully avoided. The pro-choice camp generally emphasises other legitimate aspects of the ethical dilemma, and understandably so: negating the “heartbeat” argument is a squeamish prospect that would be at odds with the pro-choice cause. But a host of personal and medical imperatives for abortion deserve sober consideration, including the notion that a woman should have autonomy over her own body; that she should have the power to choose what occurs within it; that she should have the ability to decide whether to carry a child conceived of rape or incest; that she should be able to assess her own personal and economic stability, as well as that of her environment, while considering whether to bring forth a child; that she should have access to life-saving treatment should her pregnancy endanger her own well-being.</p><p>Nineteen seventy-nine marked the final year of Cambodian tyrant Pol Pot’s five-year genocide, which resulted in the slaughter of nearly two million civilians, or a quarter of Cambodia’s population. (Bear with me.) It was the year of Saddam Hussein’s purge of the Iraqi Ba’ath Party, which, in Stalin-esque fashion, paved the way to his own absolutist reign. It was the year, too, of the All Saints’ Massacre in Bolivia, during which more than a hundred peaceful protesters were liquidated for opposing the dictatorship of Alberto Natusch Busch. Yet, in her acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize of that year, Mother Teresa claimed that “the greatest destroyer of peace today is the cry of the innocent unborn child.”<br><br>Less than twenty years later, Bill Clinton (of all people) claimed that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare.” Clinton’s slogan, though memorable, has become unfashionable in this moment of uncompromising partisanship. Instead, we have, on one hand, the assertion that abortion is tantamount to murder; on the other, that women who have abortions should do so without “sadness, shame or regret.” What is lost amid the zealousness of the current debate is a note of subtlety, and an admission, on both sides, of the nuances that surround abortion.<br><br>In essence, the dispute over abortion can be reduced to a single question. Which is the more significant moral priority: the potential for life, or the persistence of life? Or, to put it bluntly, which life deserves greatest consideration: a child’s, or a woman’s? Yet it deserves more thought than what little is demanded of a simple, unreflecting adherence to ideology, religion, or party.<br><br>Both extremes contain paradoxes and hypocrisies. Nowhere else does the right-wing defend so fervently (or at all) the necessity for state intervention in private life. Nor does the left-wing demand as strongly in any other sphere that the individual be left alone by the rights-thieving hands of the government. An anti-abortion activist might ask of the typically progressive pro-choice faction: Why is the extinction of myriad species, and the health of the planet itself, of so much apparent concern, but not the lives of unborn children? Why does the termination of animal life, but not of developing human life, inspire unease?</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""500px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c9109ccb666996715c95_let-it-all-out.jpg""></div></figure><p>Meanwhile, an abortion-rights campaigner may equally demand to know how the broadly reactionary pro-life movement can reconcile an obsession with preserving life with an ideology that is in favour of unforgiving law-and-order policies, aggressive military intervention, and the death penalty; that is against gun control, immigration, and welfare, as well as other measures designed to alleviate the worst effects of hereditary poverty. Pro-life—until the moment of birth. But where is the care for life beyond birth? Pro-life—but for an unmerciful type of life that excludes all but the most primitive notion of justice.<br><br>What can the pro-life movement offer to mothers? Its uncompromising stance seems to hang disadvantaged, violence-prone mothers out to dry: no matter how few necessities a woman is able to afford for her child, no matter how battered and bruised, no matter (for fundamentalists) if she is forcibly impregnated, she is shown no mercy. She must raise her child despite the horrors she has faced; despite the horrors her child may be likely to face. Is this truly an attitude of compassion, as is asserted in pro-life circles?<br><br>What can the pro-choice side offer to the concerned conscience? While a vulnerable child raised in destitution is a pitiable figure, is not its chance of a decent life great enough to silence any justification for violating life’s sanctity? Is not the possibility of a child’s overcoming difficult circumstances, and achieving some joy, enough to make the denial of that chance seem cruel and unjustified? Does the approval of abortion not imply a reckless and dubious assumption of moral authority—the authority to end a new life? Pro-choice—but whose choice is it to make?<br><br>The pro-life movement fixates on the “dignity” of unborn children. Here, we find the most specious, insincere aspect of the anti-abortion doctrine. The sanctimonious appeal to dignity is deceitful and designed to cast abortion proponents as amoral, in contrast to the broadly Christian notion of morality that many disciples of pro-life share.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5e41db29c2af6067bcc8b340_this-is-so-dumb.jpg""></div></figure><p>These apostles would do well to swallow their own medicine, and revisit the words of Jesus himself: “If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,’ but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (James 2:15–17). In other words, practice what you preach. If pro-life preaches compassion, then it must also demonstrate compassion in order to uphold the legitimacy of its position. Pro-lifers lose all credibility in limiting their empathy to the womb. They do not extend it to those whom they would otherwise prevent from having abortions—all those mothers and families who struggle every day to maintain their dignity in the face of hatred and violence, at the mercy not just of an indifferent world but of pro-life activists themselves. When opponents of abortion no longer debase themselves (to say nothing of the women they besiege), they can sermonize more honestly about “dignity.”<br><br>Pro-choice faces its greatest pitfall in its failure to provide a compelling counterargument to assuage anxieties surrounding, so to speak, the “heartbeat” of the abortion debate. Its rhetoric has been criticized for “dehumanizing” what pro-lifers prefer to call “unborn children,” by referring to them instead as foetuses, lumps of tissue, or collections of insensate cells. These criticisms stem from a reluctance on the part of the pro-choice camp—which portrays abortion as a routine matter of healthcare—to acknowledge the moral gravity of abortion. For critics, a discussion of abortion without this sort of concession is unfeeling and disrespectful. But pro-choice advocates have done little to dispel these accusations. What must be admitted is that abortion-rights activists do take a utilitarian approach to morality: they may recognize abortion as unsavoury, but, given certain preconditions, see a greater ethical priority in protecting a mother’s interests. This is a credible position that pro-choice is nevertheless loath to defend. In avoiding an honest discussion, the pro-choice movement has allowed detractors to define what it believes—that abortion advocates, who are inhumane, do not care about foetuses (or, if you prefer, the unborn), and do not flinch at the idea of abortion. The public, however, deserves to know what pro-choice truly represents.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5e41db29c2af6067bcc8b340_this-is-so-dumb.jpg,"When does life begin?

Financially speaking, ILSI’s global operations rely in large part on the generosity of its constituent members. In 2017, three quarters (over sixteen million dollars) of its revenue were attributed to “member support.” Of special interest are the names that make up ILSI’s markedly charitable membership. This is because, insofar as those names might be expected to apply to persons, there are none. Instead, ILSI’s current list of North American members is made up of such grave monikers as DuPont Nutrition &amp; Health, General Mills, Kellogg Company, PepsiCo — and the Coca-Cola Company.</p><p><br></p><p>It is easy, then, to suspect that ILSI may be up to something less than altruistic, despite its sunny rhetoric. But it seems to have anticipated that worry, stating reassuringly that it “does not lobby … or make policy recommendations.” That it sees the need to say so at all should give any half-alert person at least a half-second’s pause.</p><p><br></p><p>Nonetheless, ILSI seems to have insinuated itself into the regulatory apparatus of several burgeoning economies, including India’s and China’s. Beijing’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, does not merely share personnel with ILSI’s so-called Focal Point in China (including that branch’s director). Rather, the latter brazenly operates from within the very offices of the former. Lo and behold, a report published this year in the BMJ suggests that ILSI, acting as a front for its corporate membership, influenced China’s policies on obesity in favour of industrial food producers. Likewise, in India, a panel of three experts assembled to review the purposeful delay of its government’s decision to mandate the pasting of warning labels on unhealthful packaged foods included Dr. Boindala Sesikeran — nutritionist, trustee of ILSI, and a former advisor to Nestlé.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5e17c59c7cb8726bc94b2eed_mask_ILSI_700x958.jpg""></div></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>In both accounts, we see the regulators and the regulated collapse into one unaccountable mass. And this is to say nothing of ILSI’s myriad other unsavoury ventures, in the developed as much as the developing world, to bend public policy to benefit corporate interest. Indeed, it seems as if Big Food, ILSI, and their mutual higher-ups are complicit in a conspiracy of greed and misinformation, at the expense of the world’s eating public. However, as for conflicts of interest, ILSI reassures us that we need not worry. “All ILSI’s activities,” it insists, “are conducted in an open and transparent manner.”</p><p><br></p><p>That claim is doubtful. A (widely criticized) recent study, authored principally by epidemiologist Bradley C. Johnston of Dalhousie University, attempted to refute the consensus that eating red, processed meats contributes to the risk of cancer and heart disease. Three years prior, in a study funded by ILSI, Johnston sought to cast doubt on guidelines that warn consumers of health risks associated with sugar. Though Johnston has claimed that his research on meat was conducted without support from ILSI, he failed to disclose his past ties to it — which might just have made him, like many scientists whose consciences ILSI has assimilated, seem a corporate stooge out to discredit claims damaging to industry’s namesake — before having published his recent paper.</p><p><br></p><p>Clearly, corporate food and public-health policy cannot be counted as separate and distinct interests — not here, not abroad, perhaps not anywhere. For decades, under the guise of “health” and “well-being,” ILSI has insidiously embedded its brood of lies into the conversation about what is healthy, and what is not. Those lies, and the very people who tell them, have burrowed into the safeguards (including the CDC), now corrupt, designed to protect the public’s wellbeing. In a system that makes this possible, who are we to trust? Perhaps the only refuge of conscientious eaters lies in the soil of backyards and plant-pots. But lest any pests get in there, don’t forget your Raid.</p><p><br></p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5e17c54151f8f53f5c14e936_beet_the_system_800x1050.jpg,"It describes itself as “a nonprofit, worldwide organization whose mission is to provide science that improves human health and well-being.” Since its foundation more than forty years ago (by a Coca-Cola executive), it has rosily convened “scientists from the public and private sectors to collaborate in a neutral forum on scientific topics of mutual interest.”

There is a huge danger of the rise of totalitarian regimes worse than anything we’ve seen before.</h4><p>In the 20th century you had a totalitarian regime that monitored what people were doing, but they couldn’t go under the skin and monitor what people were actually feeling and thinking. This was absolutely impossible. They didn’t have the technology or computing power to analyze all the data.</p><p>Now for the first time in history it is becoming feasible to monitor everybody all the time, and not just what we do, but even what we feel. We have been hearing for many years about the rise of surveillance, but most people are still focused on what you would call “over the skin surveillance” — what you do, not what happens inside your body. Like we already know that corporations and governments can know that you are now watching this show, and they can know if you watch BBC Hardtalk, and they can deduce from that all kinds of things about your political views, about your artistic taste, even about your personality. But this is still limited. They don’t know, yet, what you’re actually feeling as you’re watching us. Do you think that I’m talking nonsense? Do you think that I am correct and you are becoming very afraid? Are you bored and looking for the remote control to switch to another channel? They don’t know that! But once you have under-the-skin surveillance, you can know that. Because emotions and feelings are biological phenomena, just like fever, and if you are wearing a bracelet that constantly monitors your body temperature, your heart rate, your blood pressure, and other biometric data, it can know not only if you have a fever, but also know if you are angry, or you feel joyful, or bored.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f4432e75d0cfb1cb870906e_street_surveillance_590x380.jpg,"I’m not against surveillance per se.

We like working in silos, rather than working together as a group. Also, we “rely heavily on analytic thinking over more holistic approaches to problems.” And why wouldn’t we?

The rest of the world prefers solidarity to “success.” We’re the reverse.</p><p>Guess what? That’s not just WEIRD. It’s weird.</p><p>And now the revenue stream of our weirdness is drying up. And the bill is coming due.</p><p>Because the world is now faced with problems so big that holistic thinking is the only way we’re going to grok them. And egoless collective effort is the only way to solve them. And those “primitive” rituals are the only way we’re going to cope with them without going mad.</p><p>In other words, it’s time to have the humility to say: We’re stuck in the mud here.

All the publicity in this region is designed by a young person for free because they want to participate and learn in the workshops. Another person does the printing, another person brings wood. No money has changed hands setting up Casa Delle Erbe and we have no sponsors. People come to us and offer the skills they have in order to join and learn. Those who learn become teachers and inspire more people to learn and teach. This is a movement which multiplies from its own energy.”</p><p>In parts of Europe where the economy is in decline and young people have no clear future, this represents a dynamic solution.

Liberal hawk. War dove. Academic circles may prefer ‘liberal interventionist.’ The term applies to left-wingers who are committed to using military force to preserve and promote human rights. Their support for the invasion of Iraq confused some people. Aren’t lefties supposed to oppose the war? </p><p>Many in the liberal hawk camp downplayed the relevance of the more dubious motives for attacking Iraq – supposed weapons of mass destruction and links to al Qaeda – in favor of a bigger point: removing Saddam Hussein from power would free millions of people from the torture and abuse of a brutal dictator. So it was a good thing. Well, not necessarily ‘good,’ but the lesser of two evils. That’s how liberal hawk posterboy Michael Ignatieff framed it. In <em>The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror</em>, Ignatieff argued that in order to combat serious evil, “we may have to traffic in evils: indefinite detention of suspects, coercive interrogations, targeted assassinations, even pre-emptive war.” He wrote those words before the evils carried out in Abu Ghraib prison were revealed. The scandal forced him to reassess his stance and note that, “Everything I’ve said and believed since I was 18 is on the line over this war, and I could be seriously wrong.” But Ignatieff – who is no apologist for the Bush administration – remained confident that the January 30 Iraqi elections would make up for the transgressions of the US occupiers. In fact, he noted in <em>The New York Times Magazine </em>that “Establishing free institutions in Iraq was the best reason to support the war – now it is the only reason.”</p><p>The use of military interventions to make the world a better place is an idea bigger than Ignatieff or the Iraqi elections. It is as old as the primordial strongman who conquered neighboring tribes to establish peace in the region. Subsequent rulers and kings have consolidated power and disarmed their opponents all in the name of peace. European empires applied this mentality on a global scale, as epitomized by the UK’s Pax Brittanica. Their conquests were rooted in the Christian imperative to ‘save’ the world. Although the church had originally been pacifist, Christian leaders came to sanction violence as they took greater responsibility for public order. But to keep moral standards paramount, they developed a comprehensive just war theology that demands stringent criteria be met before resorting to violence. Some even refer to this as “innocent violence” because it is supposedly executed justly on behalf of the people. The use of force is an imperfect solution, but we live in an imperfect world.</p><p>Today, memories of the Nazi holocaust and the more recent Rwandan genocide play an enormous role in shaping liberal interventionist doctrine. Genocide expert Samantha Power – whose office is just down the hall from Ignatieff’s at Harvard University’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy – has argued that we must go beyond the rhetoric of “Never again!” She has called on the US president to develop a military contingency plan to prevent future genocides not because of strategic considerations, but because “it’s the moral thing to do.” </p><p>But why is a military offensive the holy grail of options? In their rush to see the sheriff run Saddam out of town, many liberal hawks overlooked Bush’s refusal to heed international opinion and exhaust diplomatic channels. Some mimicked the president’s air of conceit. Prominent liberal hawk Christopher Hitchens even gave the impression that he took pleasure in taking shots at his leftist colleagues. It’s as if he’s so enamored by his move stateside that he needs to match the bully posturing of his hosts. </p><p>This starry-eyed love affair with the US may explain why Hitchens and others supported Bush’s rushed military timetable. And this is the crux of their failure. If they had devoted their power of persuasion to removing Saddam through diplomacy, 100,000 Iraqi lives could have been spared. The liberal hawks still claim the war was worth it. But what if the missiles had been directed at their loved ones? </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5fd14b9a602ed384ca7fbf00_liberal_hawks_article_boys_staring_dead_body_600x600.jpg,You’ve heard the terms.

Paraphrasing Benjamin, Žižek says in the film that all the unsettled ghosts of the past will at last find rest in the new freedom born out of the true revolution to come.

What ghosts haunt our present? What injustices await deliverance from the purgatory of lost causes? Following Benjamin’s logic, if we want our fight — for a better world, for a livable world, for life itself — to be a successful fight, we had better make sure we know what undead armies stand behind us. Without setting their struggles to rights, they will remain our curse. Plus, there is always the risk that we might fail, and in failing join their ranks, dooming ourselves to wait for the next righteous heave to drag us out of the boneyard and into the future. That is, if a shred of hope for any kind of future — indeed, if the planet itself — survives us. </p><p id="""">Of course, to try to list all the neglected wrongs of the past would be a futile exercise. The point here is not to be exhaustive but selective. Some cry out from the dark dungeons of history with more urgency than others. And if you listen closely, you just might recognize something familiar in their voices, even something of your own. True to Benjamin’s thinking, it seems injustice doesn’t die so easy after all.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">The first unavenged cause to consider is the cause of democracy. Not just your newscaster’s or your pundit’s democracy but the kind of democracy that reaches beyond the legislature and into the bank, the hospital, the break room, the trading-room floor. Make no mistake: democracy, in the narrow sense of elections and day-to-day political life, is everywhere either broken or threatening to break. Yet at the same time, a deeper erosion is taking place. Before even getting a ballot in your hands, the wind-up toy of politics has determined what kind of candidate you can vote for, and which is off limits. Even more radical candidates, in the rare instances in which they win, face stiff constraints as to what money-power will allow once they are in office. </p><p id="""">More and more, it is the interests of private wealth, not of the popular will, that decides the limits of political possibility. The big firms hold the pen that writes the law. The platforms own the means of communication. The oligarchs pull the strings of global finance. Money sloshes back and forth across international boundaries a million times a minute, while human beings pile up at militarized checkpoints only to face deportation, depredation, and death. Calls for a democratic workplace are throttled, and our needy neighbours are left for all-but-dead, while the proprietors of the workplace enjoy the privileges of legal leniency, tax delinquency, and the relief of public funds. There is one rule for the rich and another for the rest. So long as this two-tiered system exists, there can be no true democracy. It will remain a dream of the abstract, ancient past. </p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">A regime of pillage calls out for redress, a regime of world-spanning imperialism. While the last empires seem to have died out by the close of the last century, they did so only in name. Today, there still exists a system of exploitation and expropriation that preys upon the vulnerable from the remove of the wealthy West — or more accurately, the Global North. It is based on the historically entrenched notion of racial and cultural superiority of some, on the one hand, and the expendability of rest, on the other. It deems some resources, and some lives, the justifiable targets of plunder, and a minority living far away its rightful beneficiaries. It is what gives shape to parallel forms of oppression based on the constructions of gender and race in the imperialist, which is to say capitalist, core. </p><p id="""">Imperialism is at play when workers paid less than a living wage in, say, Bangladesh make the cheap clothing bought by hard-pressed workers in North America. It is also at play when some, for the simple fact of their class or race or gender, face a disproportionate risk of complication and death when giving birth, for example, in the wealthiest nation on Earth. While the most brutal shape of imperialism has receded from view — the unabashed imperialism of slavery and genocide — it lives on in the hardly subtler forms of coercion, colonialism, apartheid, and debt discipline. Marching hand in hand with the forces aligned against democracy, imperialism — if it is allowed to persist — will ensure that a sane, sustainable world may never come to be. </p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Once upon a time, it was decided there is a divide separating “Man” from “Nature.” It was deemed the proper place of the former to dominate and despoil the latter. We are living today, as we face the total collapse of the possibility of life on Earth, with the consequences of this ideology when taken to its logical extreme. For centuries, despite all cries of warning, the nonhuman world around us has been treated as a neutral, infinitely renewable fount of exploitable resources. By whom? By the “Man” on the other side of “Nature,” who is no universal human being, but rather a highly particular one: white, wealthy, and male, comfortably inhabiting the cities of the Global North on the backs of legions at the fringes. Only in time did collaborationist counterparts outside his race, gender, and geographical milieu come to crib his method and play his games. </p><p id="""">Now, we live in a world crying out for relief. Yet for all the signs pointing towards our doom, we keep on marching along the cusp of the abyss. Even as the word “extinction” becomes part of everyday speech, the forests are razed, the oil is extracted, and the fumes belch forth into the warming air. Sea levels rise, threatening not only property values but the lives of millions. The temperature climbs. The storms get deadlier. The droughts become more frequent and more devastating. The altered climate threatens to unravel everything. Still, we are told there is nothing wrong with the way things are, only there are certain things about it that could be fixed — for the right price tag. </p><p id="""">This is the logic of species-level suicide, to say nothing of the plight of other life forms. It is baked into the machinery of capitalism, which runs blind on the inertia of profit. We cannot hope to go on as we have done without bringing on the conditions for our annihilation. We must cut the engine before it is too late. The trouble is, we don’t hold the keys; corporations, their operators, and their enablers in government do. It might be time to consider how we take them for ourselves, and by what means. </p><p id="""">Imperialism, democracy’s erosion, the death of nature: these three agents of historical peril are united, like an unholy trinity, in a further, overarching force. That force hardly needs naming: it is capitalism itself. Capital is what seeks to justify plunder at large in the interest of profits at home. It seeks to dismantle any real system of representation, and instead hold the reins of power for itself. It sees as its domain the whole of the Earth, which it will gladly squeeze to exhaustion, its own furtherance be damned. Capital is in it for today and for itself alone. Come tomorrow, if we do nothing to stop it, there may be nothing left for the rest of us. <em id="""">If we do nothing. </em></p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6499e8d3f5fc6b1c0faaae3b_long%20justice.jpg,"Every revolution, every authentic revolution, promises to redeem the failures of its predecessors.

Culturally, socially, materially, the setting of your upbringing, specific to time and place, cannot but impress itself on you. And the parts of your upbringing that are not unique to you, but which are shared by all your coevals, likewise inform their sensibilities, bringing about a cohort of young people with similar experiences, common attitudes, kindred beliefs — in other words, a new generation. At least, that is the first assumption of the theory of generations. Generations, the theory holds, are defined by the events that their constituents witness together; by the culture that shapes them and which in turn they shape. Some generations are noted for the upheavals they lived through, others for those they precipitated. Some revered the past, while others broke with it. In the popular though specious tradition of generation-naming, some are lauded as “the greatest,” while others are maligned as “lost” or “silent.” Others yet are known by a single aloof letter (“Gen X”), or named for their sudden abundance (“baby boomers”) or for the timing of their births (“millennials”).</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:540px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""540px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0ce4f4f74b3b4788f2d7c1_looking_back_in_anger_post_coronavirus_540x180.jpg""></div></figure><p>Keir Milburn has recently made his own contribution to this tradition with his book, <em>Generation Left</em>. “Something remarkable has happened over the last few years,” Milburn claims. “Young people are much more likely to vote Left and hold left-wing views, while older generations are more likely to vote Right and hold conservative social, and increasingly political, views.” The book “traces the emergence of Generation Left through two international waves of development: the protest wave of 2011 and the electoral turn in the years that followed,” with the financial crisis of 2008 being “the key event of our time.” </p><p>Milburn’s notion of generations is based on that of early-twentieth-century German sociologist Karl Mannheim. In Mannheim’s eyes, generations form not one after another, in cycles or in sequence, but only in reaction to moments of rapid, widespread, and disruptive change. These convulsive fits impress themselves deeply on young people’s budding sense of reality. Conversely older people, whose worldviews have already coalesced, tend to ascribe to such disruptions much less gravity. The resulting discrepancy between the attitudes of the old and the young, according to Mannheim, marks the emergence of a new generation.</p><p>In Milburn’s telling, the Mannheimian spasm that spawned Generation Left was the financial crisis of 2008. After thirty years of stability, interest rates were low and regulation was relaxed. Blamelessly, many Americans saw their chance to buy a home, with a white picket fence and all the rest. Banks gambled, issuing unprecedented millions of “subprime” mortgages — high-risk mortgages lent to customers with poor credit — to take advantage of the swell in demand. Then the housing bubble burst. Subprime mortgage-borrowers defaulted, and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) became nearly worthless. Banks and other financial institutions, having masses of “toxic” MBSs on their books, seized up and threatened to fold. Almighty dollars were suddenly in short supply. Markets crashed, evictions and foreclosures abounded, unemployment surged. Bailouts of historic proportions, issued by the Federal Reserve, propped up not only those American institutions famously deemed “too big to fail,” but the deeply interconnected economy of entire the globe. In short, the suburbs wept, Wall Street heaved, the world groaned, and the Fed saved the day.</p><p>Did it really? In a classic case of “socialism for the rich and rugged capitalism for the poor,” the wealthy perpetrators of the crash got off easy; all things considered, many even made hay of it. The Fed never quite weaned Wall Street off its teat, putting by trillions-worth of assets in order to prop up the financial sector. Meanwhile, droves of Americans, and much of the world besides, never recovered. A decade later, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that the average American had lost $70,000 in lifetime income as a result of the Great Recession. Roughly 7.5 million American jobs were lost between 2007 and 2009, with the middle- and working-classes particularly hard-hit. And though labour’s share of American GDP, in wages and benefits, has been eroding for decades, a study conducted last year by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company found that three quarters of the nine-per-cent decrease between 1947 and 2016 took place since the dawn of the new millennium. As Dante Dallavalle and Christian Parenti remarked in <em>Jacobin</em>, labour’s share of the national income “has not yet even returned to pre-recession levels.” The tide did rise, but only a very few big boats were lifted while the rest ran aground.</p><p>During the decade that followed, many came into maturity not only less prosperous but, in violation of the great promise of postwar capitalism, with poorer prospects than their parents. Growing up in the face of greater adversity — lower wages, greater debt, higher property prices, a more precarious job-market — members of Generation Left were thus, according to Milburn, more likely than their elders to be drawn to radical alternatives. They were not as inclined to cling to the past, nor were they as adverse to risk, having less to lose. They were more sympathetic to the notion of, say, occupying Zuccotti Park, not only to decry the Fed’s handling of the financial crisis but to call for a total restructuring of an unjust and broken “system.” Milburn draws a straight line between the youthful enthusiasm for Occupy Wall Street and other protests in 2011 and, in the years following, support for an ascendant “left populism” in Europe and North America. Trading placards for clipboards, by Milburn’s account, Occupiers and their comrades sank their energies into the campaigns of Podemos in Spain, SYRIZA in Greece, Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom, and Bernie Sanders in the United States.</p><p>As evidence of this “electoral turn,” Milburn cites a “much-repeated” finding of the British polling firm YouGov. The firm found that, in the United Kingdom’s general election in 2017, the likelihood of voting for the Conservative part increased (and for Labour, decreased) by nine per cent for every 10 years’ increase in a voter’s age, representing “an amazing 97 percentage point gap in voting intention between youngest and oldest voters.” And this “historically unprecedented” fissure opened up quickly: in the general election of 2010, it was a mere 15 points. As for the United States, Milburn points to the swelling membership of the Democratic Socialists of America, which grew from just 6,500 in 2016 to 50,000 in 2018; and whose average age fell from 68 to 33 between 2013 and 2017. Meanwhile, outspoken social-democrat Bernie Sanders won over younger voters in the contest to become the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in 2016. Among those 17 to 29 years of age, Sanders received 72 per cent of votes; Hilary Clinton, on the other hand, received 28 per cent. (These numbers were almost exactly the inverse in the case of senior Democrats.) Young Brits and Americans (at least the Democrats among them) indeed appear to be listing left of their elders, at least as far as is permitted within the framework of mainstream politics.</p><p>Sanders may have charmed Democrats under 30. But what about young Republicans? According to an exit poll published in <em>The New York Times</em>, 55 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 voted for Clinton in 2016. But 37 per cent of the same cohort voted for the current president, the same proportion that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. If young Democrats have drifted leftwards, there seems to be little evidence of any erosion of loyalty among their Republican peers. However, without finer longterm data, and given the dramatically different political programs that Trump and Romney each offered voters during their respective campaigns, it is difficult to determine whether any kind of ideological trend whatsoever underlies these figures. Meanwhile, in terms of policy, the still-dominant establishment wings of both parties are pushing each towards the other. As Gore Vidal quipped in 2004, “we have only one political party in the United States, the Property Party, with two right wings, Republican and Democrat.”</p><p>Which speaks to perhaps the most compelling part of Milburn’s argument. Generation Left’s parents, the baby boomers, “enjoyed … abundant cheap property, then — for those who acquired assets during the 1970s and 1980s — growing house prices, share prices and pension pots,” as reported by William Davies. In the United Kingdom, “73 per cent of those aged between 65 and 74 own their own home … compared to less than 5 per cent of under-35s.” Generation Left may as well be called Generation Rent, as Milburn jests. By and large, young people are earning less and spending more of it than ever on debts and rent.</p><p>To put things further into context, a typical British member of Generation Left “will spend ‘an average of £44,000 more on rent in their 20s’” than his or her baby-boomer counterpart. Last year, the American listings platform Apartment List estimated that “only 25 percent of millennial renters will be able to afford a 10 percent down payment on a median-priced home in the next 5 years.” To boot, according to Milburn, “young people are taking on huge sums of student debt only to discover a chronic shortage in graduate-level jobs.” Moreover, in 2016, British think tank Resolution Foundation found that, in the United Kingdom, “those aged 65–74 now hold more wealth than the entire population aged under 45 (a group more than twice their size).” In the United States, the median net worth of people under 35 is just $11,000, as reported by <em>MarketWatch</em>. Those over 75, on the other hand, have a median net worth just shy of $265,000 (skewed, no doubt, by the preponderance of the aging rich). Unlike that of the 1960s, the rift between Generation Left and its antecedents is, fundamentally, about something other than culture. As Milburn has it, it is a class-struggle delineated by age and defined by vast disparity in material wealth.</p><p>But enough of statistics. The point is that, far from the lazy, entitled children which reactionaries would have you believe they are, young people now coming of age have much to be upset about. The typical slanders that befall them speak more to the insecurities of their slanderers than to anything resembling reality. That young people are questioning the precepts of neoliberalism, as Milburn aims to show, has its basis in both material and historical circumstances. Their answers, however, may yet prove wanting.</p><p>For it is important to remember the other ideological answer, in the United States, to the events of 2008 — namely, the Tea Party movement. Representing the opposite face of the proverbial coin, it shared with Generation Left a resentment for the establishment and an eagerness for a more radical, populist politics. As much as Occupy served as a galvanizing prelude to Sanders’ run for the presidency, so could the Tea Party be construed as a portent of Donald Trump’s. And in the United Kingdom, the forces of Brexit standing behind Boris Johnson’s premiership marched to a similarly reactionary tune. Yet these transatlantic cousins have another thing in common: despite the efforts of left-listing youths, they won. Neither Corbyn nor Sanders came close to gaining the highest of offices; nor, as is now clear, will they. In light of these shortcomings, as well as those of SYRIZA and Podemos, claims of a left-wing resurgence must duly be tempered. “A new Generation Left exists for sure,” William Davies concludes. “But how they will eventually impose themselves politically, and when, is still unclear.” All the while, they must continue to fight against a rabid and rising — and presently more powerful — right-wing, which risks crushing their enthusiasm entirely.</p><p>A dozen years have passed since the financial crisis. Due to the coronavirus, the world is now set to plunge once more into recession; or as more and more economists predict, depression. If it is any kind of sign, the trillions of taxpayer dollars that the current administration has set aside for (mostly corporate) relief, dwarf the measly $831 billion that Obama approved in 2009. Further, at the time of writing, at least 36 million Americans have filed unemployment claims due to the pandemic. “The only other time in American history when unemployment was that high,” wrote Jeffry Bartash for <em>MarketWatch</em>, “was in the early stages of the Great Depression.” By all accounts, this time things will be far, far worse than the last.</p><p>It may be easy to wish for a post-pandemic Generation Left to “eventually impose themselves politically” in the wake of ongoing blunder and ruin. But time is short; and beyond the coronavirus, other hazards loom. In January, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock one hundred seconds away from midnight, closer than at any time since its establishment in 1947. The World Food Program expects the number of hungry people in the world to nearly double, from 135 to 265 million, by the end of this year. And though the climate crisis has been allayed temporarily by a plummet in fossil-fuel consumption, it will resume with a vengeance once everyone returns to work — that is, everyone who still has a job. As of yet, the pre-pandemic system persists largely unchanged. </p><p>Moreover, as Sanders himself has noted, in 2016 no more than three Americans — Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett — own more wealth than the bottom half of the country. In 2017, eight men (Bezos, Gates, and Buffet among them) owned as much as the poorest half of the world’s population — 3.7 billion people, by Oxfam’s count. At the same time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that nearly 40 million (12 per cent of Americans) lived in poverty, half of them in “deep” poverty. (That is, on an income of less than roughly $6,000 for a single individual, or less than double that for a family of four.) Last year alone, almost 140 million Americans reported financial hardship due to overwhelming medical expenses. This is all to say nothing of the fallout from the pandemic, which menaces everyday working people to a vastly greater degree than their wealth-insulated, comfortably self-isolated peers.</p><p>Contrary to received neoliberal wisdom, these are not the bitter-but-inevitable facts of life. The extent of inequality and of suffering within the borders of the world’s richest country are the deliberate, though preventable, consequences of policymaking. And perhaps far more so than the last, the current crisis will benefit the usual suspects at the peril of the rest. (Bezos himself has reportedly made over $25 billion, and counting, since January.) Already, some of the hallmarks of the post-2008 era are returning. Right-wing anti-lockdown protests may be ugly, but (seen generously, perhaps) they are at least partly symptomatic of grievances as credible as those of the Tea Party’s or Donald Trump’s followers. Wage earners and factory-floor workers, mortgagors and debtors, medical personnel and migrants, hard-working people of all kinds are hurting. Some form of universal basic income, a temporary rent-freeze, and debt-forgiveness might each do something to mitigate their pain temporarily. But the underlying cause of their anguish cannot be addressed without a broader political reckoning.</p><p>As 2016 bore witness, that anguish can quite easily turn into a toxic, yet politically potent, form of rage if exploited by an opportunistic demagogue. If that same fate is to be avoided, if the resentment of the downtrodden is to be reckoned with, if a more just future is to be realized, then more than just the young must get serious about reimagining their politics. For if old and new generations cannot find common cause, then the as-yet neoliberal world risks plunging ever deeper into inequality and instability. As abolitionist minister Theodore Parker said, “things refuse to be mismanaged long.” History offers not a few examples of how things turned out once they reached a breaking point. But history does not repeat itself, and should not be used as a crystal ball. A new political consciousness may yet emerge from this crisis. Whether for better or worse, of the left or the right, it is too soon to say. What seems certain, however, is that the status quo cannot persist for much longer without undergoing a further, fatal rupture. The time is ripe to write what comes next.</p><p>‍</p><p>— <strong>Trevor Clarke</strong><em> </em></p><p><em>Trevor Clarke (not to be confused with Trevor R. R.

I recall reading articles about his brutal crackdown taking thousands of lives and placing the Philippines into a human rights crisis. But what really stood out to me was when he detained senator Leila de Lima, his most notable domestic critic, on charges for illegal drug trading, an offence she’s firmly denied. I was appalled by his power.

His ""war on drugs"" has seen government forces kill over twelve thousand, mostly poor, many children. Among them are protestors and rival politicians. But the citizens of his country don't lie on the outside. For them, the strongman is taking on the drug dealers, taking hard steps to do what must be done. This is a state of emergency, after all --civil liberties can always be sidestepped.<br>‍<br>For anyone worried about the country's drug problem, the strong man comes in and solves everything. Almost overnight, the drug dealers are rendered invisible and all is well-- Until anyone opposes his administration, or runs against him. Then the strong leader"" shows his teeth, and those who voted for him have the bodies of innocent children to answer for.</p><p>On one of our first days we went to the Tatay Public Market, an outdoor market in the slums of Rizal. It consisted of hundreds of tents and rugged buildings filled with stalls of clothes as cheap as 50 Philippine pesos (equivalent to about one Canadian dollar). That’s where I first saw signs regarding a fine for littering around the area. In fact nowadays there’s also a hefty ticket fee that can run up to 5,000 pesos for smoking in public places. He even closed down a popular tourist spot, Boracay, for an island cleanup in April that’s set to be lifted in October of next year.</p><p>I got even more perspective when I spoke to my cousin, Madeline, who voted for Duterte in 2016. She explained how he wanted to enforce regulations regarding “unli rice”, short for unlimited rice, an option most popular fast food places offered for as cheap as 30 pesos. She also added how he had taxed soft drinks and other junk foods to encourage Filipinos to eat healthier. After our conversation, I was unsure whether she was defending him or reassuring herself that she voted for the right candidate.</p><p>The conversation with my cousin made me think of this young man that we met toploading on a jeepney in Bontoc, in Northern Philippines. We had just gotten tattoos from the national artist, Whang-od the day before and we were on our way to Sagada. He saw our tattoos and sparked a conversation with my sister and she asked him if he had any, “I don’t have any tattoos because Duterte doesn’t like them,” he replied. I was shocked, here’s a man who’s enforcing changes but has the country on edge.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18a1f9404dff21c3e3675c_Duarte-banner.png,"Something that caught my eye as we were stuck in the dreadful Manila traffic, with cars bumper to bumper as far as your eyes can see, was the countless murals of Rodrigo Duterte plastered around the city.

The sun shines, tempting you to idle by a sleepy Moravian town’s only swimming pool. The day’s balmy embrace leaves your skin aglow, as if with its own modest radiance. As you approach the poolside, a tepid breeze half-heartedly churns the dust on the road and stirs the leaves on the trees into a chorus of hushed murmurs. The sunlight breaks gently through the branches, casting a mottled patchwork of glimmering shade onto the encircling lawn. The crowd at the water’s edge moves about indifferently, languid and lazy as the day. It is as if nature has conspired to render the world benign and comfortable for your benefit.</p><p>As you begin to undress, revealing the swimsuit beneath your summer frock, a vague shadow appears beyond the chain-link fence. Its darkness is striking amid the bright of day. As it emerges from between the tree-trunks, its shape becomes discernible: it is a man’s, squalidly attired, with a disheveled beard and matted hair. In his filthy hands, he holds a crude object assembled from shards and lumps of discarded material. A cylinder, perhaps a cardboard tube, projects outwards from the thing; he holds it up to his eye like a makeshift camera. Wordlessly, as if unnoticed, he apes taking your picture, and smiles a vagabond’s grin.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5dcc9a2c449e598a82345dda_perv-1.jpg""></div></figure><p>The town is Kyjov, in the southeast of the Czech Republic; the man is Miroslav Tichý; and the camera, in fact, is real. During some twenty years, from the 1960s until the 1980s, Tichý took tens if not hundreds of thousands of ghostly photographs, mostly of unsuspecting women, with primitive cameras that he made from whatever he had at hand. For lenses, he used Plexiglas, ground and polished with toothpaste and cigarette ash; for shutter mechanisms, spools of wood and ribbons fashioned from the elastic waistbands of threadbare underwear; for rewind knobs, caps from beer bottles; for mounts, wood or cardboard.</p><p>The resulting images are, in the words of Tichý’s onetime neighbour, Roman Buxbaum, “underexposed or overexposed, out of focus, made from scratched negatives, developed on paper that is either cut by hand or even torn.” They feature women (or their disembodied, eroticized parts) of all ages, in haphazard scenes of everyday life, in the streets and parks of Kyjov. A few of the subjects, flattered, smile or pose spontaneously; others scowl into the lens. Most seem to be caught unawares, the captor of their images peering at them surreptitiously, at a distance. Tichý’s brutal post-production treatment of his photographs — which, according to Buxbaum, included “dust and dirt on everything, filth in the camera and in the darkroom, finger prints [<em>sic</em>], bromide stains, places gnawed by rats and silverfish” — only adds to their haunting, forlorn, and foreboding character.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5dcc9a47449e595397345e13_perv-2.jpg""></div></figure><p>“When I was a little boy,” recounts Buxbaum, “my grandmother used to say: ‘Wash your hands! Otherwise you’ll be like Mirek Tichý!’ For my grandmother, Tichý was a prime example of what not to be.” In 2005, Kyjov’s then-mayor, while admiring some of Tichý’s photographs in Zürich, explained that he had known of Tichý since his childhood (“since I went to the swimming pool,” where Tichý was forbidden to enter), when fellow children thought of Tichý as a frightening, spectral presence. Believing his cameras to be false, they bought into the local folklore, which described Tichý as a sort of madman. “Now” that the mayor could appreciate his work, “I would like to take my hat off to him.”</p><p>Notoriety came late to Tichý. The accumulating results of his prodigious, years-long project were discovered only in 1981, when Buxbaum (who has made a short documentary, <em>Tarzan Retired</em>, about Tichý), was permitted, after more than a decade of exile, to return to Kyjov from Switzerland. (Buxbaum’s family had escaped Czechoslovakia during the Soviet invasion in 1968.) And it was not until 2004 that Tichý’s photographs were exhibited for the first time, at the International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Seville. Larger, solo exhibitions — such as those in Zürich, Paris, and New York (in 2005, 2008, and 2010 respectively) — helped to garner ever wider appreciation for his work.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5dcc9a5a449e59296c345e7b_perv-3.jpg""></div></figure><p>By then, Tichý had long ceased to take photographs: “I had a planned number I wanted to do: I would make such and such a number a day, such and such a number in five years, and when I did it, I quit,” sometime in the mid-1980s. But even longer before, he had renounced another artistic calling. In 1945, Tichý attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, where he painted in the modernist style of the prewar era. But after the Communist coup in 1948, Tichý’s freedom to paint was severely restricted. He refused to depict the narrow, political subjects that the Communists censors demanded, and dropped out of the Academy.</p><p>Then began a period of crisis, disillusionment, and passive resistance. Strangeness and nonconformity made him a suspicious figure in the eyes of the authorities. “He was the opposite,” in Buxbaum’s view, “of the ideal new Socialist man.” His previous treatment at a psychiatric hospital (psychiatry being an infamously abused instrument of Soviet and Soviet-allied persecution), paired with his increasingly shambolic appearance, gave police sufficient pretext to periodically incarcerate Tichý — purportedly to “normalize” him, in accordance with ideological standards — in a psychiatric clinic. He would return a few days later, shaven and bathed, only for the abuse to repeat itself, mostly at the occasion of political holidays. Tichý came to accept his lot, readying a small suitcase before each predicted visit of the police. He stoutly refused, however, to accept normalization.</p><p>Tichý came to rent an attic in the home of Buxbaum’s grandmother, and therein set up a studio. But when the home was nationalized, he was threatened with eviction, the space that he occupied having been intended for the use of a collective of leather-goods menders. Standing his ground, Tichý was forced out for “economic-political, social, and also security reasons.” His paintings were cast into the street; he never painted again. But his creative spirit adapted. “The Stone-Age photographer was the embodiment of an insult to the small-town Communist elite,” wrote Buxbaum. “He became the living antithesis of progressive thought, of the Marxist theory of history moving in a straight line.”</p><p>What is one to make of Tichý? Do his photographs truly smack of artistic ingenuity, or are they simply the product of serendipitous chance? Is the element of the voyeuristic, the intrusive in his gaze to be excused on the grounds of its aesthetic merits? Tichý certainly had no illusions as to his talent: “If you want to be famous, you have to do something so badly that no one else in the world does it as badly!” As to the erotic: “That always [meant] police, prison and mental institutions.” Perhaps to escape or subvert those bonds, Tichý saw his only recourse in surveillance, in the forbidden look — in an undetectable glance so alike to that of his tormentors. Whatever the truth may be, Tichý offers at least one instructive example: under conditions that are hostile to self-expression, the last refuge of the artist lies in affirming the banal, the workaday, the commonplace poetry of life. In a world that is brutalized and on fire, we may well be forced to cobble together our own creative tools from the debris and rubble. And, in face of it all, may we affirm the simple beauty of our raw humanity: it may be all that we have left.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Miroslav Tichý photos courtesy Tichy Ocean</strong></p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5dcc9a47449e595397345e13_perv-2.jpg,"The world is bright.

We are no longer propagandized exclusively as part of an audience that attends the showing of a documentary or listens to a demagogue’s speech.</p><p>Rather, with the advance of electronic communications, television, and computerization,<em> society itself</em> has become the propaganda-deliverer. Even rebellion is shaped by propaganda from the society it claims to reject. And since we ourselves are part of society, our status as Americans is ironic at its core: one of our functions is to propagandize ourselves.</p><h3>Propaganda is no longer a type of false consciousness promoted by a few major institutions (state, the educational system, the church, etc.) in support of a dominant elite. Today, propaganda has become <em>a way of life</em>, a method of interaction between individuals, groups of individuals, bureaucracies, and so on.</h3><p>Although the division between those without power and those with it remains central to U.S. life, the old ways (e.g., unions, social-justice organizations, etc.) of combating that division and the false consciousness that supports it are no longer viable. Unions and SJOs have become part of the problem in that they create the illusion of opposition without in fact opposing the way of life/social order.</p><p>Unions that allow the state to determine the number of strikers who can assemble at a plant gate are unions that have conceded the right to control union dissent to the state and big money. This is the core right that the original struggles for unionization refused to concede. As a result, they adopted a variety of unallowable/illegal tactics to achieve their ends, an approach today’s unions long ago relinquished.</p><p>A similar transformation occurred within civil rights organizations which gained their credentials during the civil rights/black power struggles of the 1950-70s. These organizations now concentrate almost entirely on legal issues.. Only the re-emergence of urban unrest in the form of spontaneous demonstrations against the police killings of unarmed blacks offers hope of a new era of racial justice struggles.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width: 100%;"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5b736cd23a4b65f8f41ca431_I-moustache-you-a-question.jpg""></div></figure><p>One could go on and on, giving examples from feminist, anti-war, and other movements of our era. They are crippled at almost every step because they believe that challenging the powers that be is only accomplished by first granting the powers that be the right to determine how, when, in what location, and under what circumstances these formations are allowed to publicly protest.</p><p>Doing so, we reinforce our roles as bottom-tiered players in a game controlled by big money and the state.</p><h3>In this way, we surrender our potential and become more politically emaciated. This leads to a new state of mind. Invisibility becomes our new vanity. Nothing pleases us more than to have grown so thin and weak that we are for all practical purposes unseen.</h3><p>In our own world, of course, we can still be seen. In the shadows at the base of the Power World to which we have no access, we are visible to those who also play-act at leading meaningful lives. </p><p>But to those in power, we are invisible beings of no consequence, except as part of the gluttonous mass which throbs outside society’s power-centers, panting for everything capitalism sells — commodities, wars, myths of freedom, love of the homeland and its flag at all costs.</p><p>In keeping with capitalism’s suffocation of our collective spirit, we have become simulcras of the selves we’d like to be, not incarnations of them. Consequently, no left revolutionary is a left revolutionary and no anti-capitalist is anti-capitalistic.</p><p>We’re not radicals, we’re fashionistas. We don’t buy into a political vision but instead buy a way of looking, a style. Worship/purchase of style is itself a political vision, rooted in an ontology which begins with the premise that decoration is the ultimate real. As a result, goals have changed.</p><p>Being antiwar is no longer the issue; the issue is dressing and talking in specific ways, surrounding oneself with the cultural artifacts of being antiwar. In this manner, one becomes antiwar while participating in the dismantlement of an existing antiwar movement, joining a self-labeled progressive contingent to elect a president (2008, 2012) who as a candidate helped redefine “anti-war” to mean <em>“let’s continue to go to war but in Afghanistan instead of Iraq”.</em></p><figure class=""w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width: 100%;"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5b736d0003163d163b60c786_na-na-na-na-na-na-hat-band.jpg""></div></figure><p>The fact that on many levels politics is reducible to fashion isn’t new. It is, however, more prevalent today than in capitalism’s previous stages. </p><p>The evidence is everywhere: the <em>New York Times ’</em>“Styles” section, red carpet fashion with as much coverage as the awards ceremonies they precede, and the makeover craze. Even tattooing has evolved in the West from a type of nonconformity into an indispensable fashion statement for those anxious to convince the world of their “outsider” bonafides.</p><p>The use of tattooing, as with the employment of other forms of body art, symbolic images, and gestures to signify identity, has become part of a process in which a symbol (e.g nose rings) which supposedly symbolizes some aspect of our character (e.g. our rebelliousness) ends up substituting for the very attitude it theoretically rejects.</p><h3>It’s no longer necessary to be rebellious or unfashionable to be considered rebellious or unfashionable. One must only own the symbols of rebellion and anti-fashion to accomplish this, which is easy since all of them are available as products in malls and online.</h3><p>In fact, the internet is itself a mall — a digital marketplace available at every hour of the day, no matter the time zone. It’s the biggest advancement in consumer capitalism’s march forward since the birth of modern advertising in the early twentieth century. </p><p>At Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, and niche sites catering to the needs of specific groups, there’s a place for everyone to shop: foot fetishists, Lutherans, anarchists, Minnesota Vikings fans, Green Party members, and so on. </p><p>No form of dissidence or nonconformity leads away from the existing political system. All lead, albeit by different routes, <em>to</em> the system – i.e., to the marketplace where one buys whatever is necessary to establish who one is.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width: 100%;"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5b736d2003163d6dfe60c79d_eye-see-ewe.jpg""></div></figure><p>This is one of the ways in which propaganda has become a way of life, reducing everything we do, no matter how much we insist otherwise, into a reinforcement of, and an advertisement for, the very system we claim to see through and rebel against. We have become the agents of our own indoctrination. </p><p>Our actions help to fine-tune a society in which Nietzsche’s “revolution in values” has become not a revolution in insight but a prod to maxing out our credit cards. By tracking our every move, digital systems transform our biological needs and intellectual interests into data to help companies inundate us with an endless slew of new products and entertainment. Capitalism<em> sells us ourselves</em> in order to keep going.</p><p>This is “who you are is what you buy” raised to the highest level. It is capitalism’s ultimate mockery of Marx whose working-class revolution, long ago devitalized by the system’s effective crushing of all movements for the radical expansion of democracy.</p><p>This analysis may seem pessimistic or cynical to some. It isn’t. </p><h3>It is merely a description of advanced capitalism/imperialism experimenting with ways to turn everything under its influence into a functioning part of the apparatus that it is.</h3><p>What this picture does NOT indicate is what cleverly made tools may be developed, then used to wreck the apparatus. Such a wrecking is entirely possible. What doesn’t seem possible, however, is that the source of this wrecking will spring from within the apparatus’ core: the United States. To do so would be the equivalent of toppling ourselves, a form of self-dethronement, a suicide. </p><p>But it could happen. Doing so will require rejecting our current governmental/economic structure and creating a mass movement for radical people-oriented change that is prepared to bring corporate power to its knees and prevent any of society’s major institutions, including the two main political parties, from interfering with our goals.</p><p>If such change does occur, it won’t be nice and we certainly won’t be able to look to the government for advice.

The experts are still grasping to understand what future implications such explosions will have on the human and natural worlds.</p><p>The first, most immediate clue one could point to would be the growing multitudes of over-weight, drug and alcohol-ridden, stressed-out bodies of so many who live increasingly self-indulgent lifestyles, oblivious to what their lifestyles in search of ‘the Good Life’ are doing to themselves, society and the natural world around them. Another clue, and possibly the chief source of so much human angst could be attributed to the same disease, at a societal level, of: so much out-of-control urban development and the sum total effects that high-density living environments already are having, compared to the way human beings, and especially those like the aboriginal Australian people, have normally lived for centuries.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18be64b92e0028b536e58d_Commercial-Drive.jpg""></div></figure><p>A mass meltdown of modern human life and city-life is unquestionably underway.

Perhaps the deciding factor will end up being the ever-dwindling source of simple building materials – such as common, ordinary sand – that’s required to make the massive amounts of concrete needed to construct what some would like to eventually see become one giant, sprawling ‘Hong Kong’ in Sydney and throughout the world?</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18be76fefbfac43cecf231_Busy_Ferhadija_street%2C_Sarajevo.jpg""></div></figure><h2>‍<strong>Maybe the answer is:<br>All of the Above!</strong></h2><p>Yet because of a wide-held belief in Sydney, as it is everywhere else in the world, in the absurd concept of perpetual growth and expansion, that could be characterized, planetary-wide, as ‘a quasi-religious belief’, it seemingly constitutes the sole answer that every government has to give for every human and societal problem. Consequently, every urban centre in the world thereby is virtually kept under perpetual siege, forced to forever totally transform itself into something entirely different again than what it was, and perhaps never wanted to actually become. Like a mad man feverishly pedalling his bike faster and faster for fear of falling over if he ever stopped and all would be doomed; these endless ‘growth solutions’ destroy what human beings perpetually long for, are fighting for, and yet are losing every day as time goes by.</p><p>The barometer is now plummetting at such an alarming rate as to suggest the coming of some kind of horrific, monstrously-violent storm of epic proportions, that one day will not only engulf cities like Sydney but all of human civilization to whatever nefarious, pitiful end.</p><p>The real culprits always are in this scenario and what is constantly being manipulated behind the scenes between the minions of:<br>investors, speculators, politicians, developers, city planners, architects, schools of business and real estate industry;<br>who seldom consider in their massive urban projects the people’s own desire for, perhaps, yet a different, slower, softer way of life, say, with more affordable housing that’s smaller, more economical, and environmentally-sensitive; built solely with recycled materials that conserve the earth’s ever-receding finite natural resources.

Even the most entrenched believers in the new global order have a mounting sense that some fundamental mindshift is needed. The contradictions of late-capitalist life put increasing pressure on our psyches to synthesize the data, yet insights come only in fits and starts. They appear like desert mirages, dazzling us with their promise and then dissolving into sand. <br></p><p id="""">And suddenly we are all wondering: What would it be like to drink deeply? Can we in the First World have a revelation? Would we recognize one if we had it?</p><p id="""">A few pioneers have been working with these questions. In the past, political radicals have been as quick as reactionary conservatives to dismiss maverick consciousness researchers. But suddenly, the discoveries of mind explorers like Stanislav Grof, Jean Houston and the recently deceased John Lilly, seem to have a penetrating cultural significance. The currency of the times is revelation and epiphany.</p><p id="""">Grof, a former Johns Hopkins professor and chief of a Maryland psychiatric research center, has scoured ancient and modern methods of consciousness change in order to develop techniques that can trigger revelatory experience rapidly and in a broad spectrum of people. In his Holotropic Breathwork technique, a combination of intense breathing, expressive music and focused bodywork causes dramatic psychological transformations in most people. Within minutes, those who try it begin to experience things more acutely (much the way people often say they do in the midst of abrupt life changes). Colors look brighter, memories appear more detailed, symbols and words provoke pluralities of interpretation. Sensitivity to sensations in the body and brain is heightened; old patterns are suddenly seen in a new light.</p><p id="""">For serious explorers, this is only the beginning.</p><p id="""">As their sensory experiences evolve, mind explorers frequently find that the psychological and the physical become intertwined, and watch amazed as each influences the other. Incorporeal presences may seem as real as the walls, walls may seem permeable, or normal material reality may dissolve into flowing energy fields. The mind’s and body's instruments of perception come to be understood as critical components in constructing a sense of reality. (What is music without our eardrums conveying it, our memories labeling it?) Even if such experiences are discounted as “hallucinations,” there is a lingering sense that normal reality itself could be one of those illusions – the ultimate meme, prolonged interminably by its social infectiousness.<br></p><p id="""">Even this is merely one stage. As revelation extends, “time” as a psychological process can stop; explorers report a sense of intense connection to their body’s internal cellular activities, to collective memory, or to other beings or the entire human race. Some feel the inextricable unity of good and evil, oppressor and oppressed, or find themselves dissolved into a universal consciousness.<br></p><p id="""">It all sounds wild and chaotic, and yet, for many of us, oddly familiar as well. Under the pressure of stress, despair or confusion, more and more of us are peering over the brink of breakthroughs of this type. Grof suggests it’s “archetypal” – as the human crisis deepens, our consciousness tries to promote healing by uncovering repressed truths.</p><p id="""">We resist the shift: Who wants to lose their grip on everyday life? We dread an exile from so-called “consensus reality,” imagining an impoverished, eternal loneliness of insanity. But in fact, those who’ve gone all the way down the rabbit hole of epiphany come back with a view of a world that has truly and profoundly changed. Grof alone has compiled records from thousands of such people. Without any coercion, the overwhelming majority emerge with a non-violent attitude, reverence for nature, anti-materialistic values, a keen interest in spiritualism (though not organized religion), a holistic approach to health, and an intense desire for social change. </p><p id="""">Why? Because one common effect of these non-ordinary states is pure awe. Even a faint glimpse beyond the spectacle and into the vastness of existence transforms into breathtaking experiential reality. This almost invariably creates deep humility before the infinite complexity of nature. Unsurpassed levels of compassion emerge from the intimate identification with other people, creatures and things. Visceral immersion in the entire human collective makes it almost impossible not to consider the effects of every personal action on the global community and future generations.</p><p id="""">Often, the end result is confusion. But rather than growing depressed or anxious or paralyzed by it, revelatory explorers tend to become irrepressible skeptics. For them, no moral perspective, dominating mood or intellectual conclusion can pass for absolute “fact” or “objective truth” very easily, or for long. Revelation is a radical deconstruction of the senses of self and reality. It allows entirely different impulses to influence your actions; it shortens the distance to spontaneity and authenticity.</p><p id="""">As long as revolutionaries have existed, they’ve sought ways to fundamentally change how people think and see the world. Frustrated, they fall back on reform: the attempt to persuade people to follow prescriptions for change. Consciously or not, most people resist. But when someone’s whole sense of reality shifts – say, when they realize that death is closer than they had allowed themselves to think – radical new decisions come effortlessly.</p><p id="""">The First World is a culture preparing for revelation. We are watching, alarmed, as rips appear in the fabric of our reality. At the same time, we are quick to forget, ignore, or send in reinforcements. How many are ready to step through the hole?</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/646e6b546ad5c1fa61843a59_on-the-brick-of-relevation.gif,"On the weather report, another record-breaking hurricane is chewing up the coast.

And we’re in it now.</h4><p>Turns out people cooped up together for extended periods — whether in submarines or Antarctic bases or space stations — go through phases.</p><p>The first phase, Quarter One, is amygdala-inoverdrive time. Think existential dread. (Or panic-buying of toilet paper.) Astronauts en route to Mars are expected to experience a jolt of fear when they can no longer see Earth in the window. The rest of us, in the early days of this lockdown, saw Covid-19 infection numbers spike exponentially and understood: there is nowhere to hide.</p><p>But acute stress levels don’t last, so in Quarter Two, fear levels off. We may start to actually enjoy what this strange circumstance has freed up. In the stillness of a shut-down world, there is peace. We nap, we paint. But this is only a bluff charge at equanimity. Because something happens just beyond the halfway point. In Quarter Three, the psyche starts to curdle.</p><p>Anxiety and depression set in. Morale crashes. For no particular reason, we want to wring each other’s necks. “July 11: Today was difficult,” wrote cosmonaut Valentin Lebedev entering Quarter Three aboard the Soviet space station Salut. “I don’t think we understand what is going on with us.” Lebedev and crewmate Anatoly Berezovoy stopped talking for two weeks. In Quarter Three, brute loneliness blooms. We understand that we have been cut away from the herd. Separated from our kind.</p><p>At this point there is only one prescription:</p><h2>When you’re </h2><h2>going through</h2><h2>hell, keep going.</h2><p>In the department of Medicine at the University of Tasmania there is a psychologist named Kimberley Norris, whose specific expertise is “confinement and reintegration.” Her research identified a possible silver lining to the kind of social experiment we’re all in. A reason to believe the Fourth Quarter will be better.</p><p>As it happens, many people who go through the trial of extended isolation — Third Quarter madness and all – say they would … do it again.</p><p>“We ask them, ‘If it’s so bad why do you keep going back?’” Norris told The Australian Broadcasting Corporation recently.</p><p>The answer is that … something happened to them in lockdown. They faced something that needed to be faced. They learned something that needed to be learned. “When people have space to sit back and think it allows them to figure out what’s important to them.” And those newly identified core values? People are also more likely to act on them.</p><p>Something else Dr. Norris observed: In the psychological hothouse of isolation, both men and women seemed to shore up undeveloped parts of themselves. Men became less insular — they started asking for help — and women become more self-confident — realizing they were more capable than they thought. Everybody sort of rebalanced. And relationships improved.</p><p>“Post-COVID we will see differences in the way people engage with each other, in the way people work, in the priorities given to the environment, and the way people think about travel,” Norris said.</p><p>It may be that that what psychologist Carol Gilligan has been calling for for decades — the shift from “an ethic of power to an ethic of care” — may finally be possible, because of this pandemic.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f20a9ea15ed462b4b9c4104_isolation_lockdown_590x380.jpg,"Those of us who aren’t on the Covid frontlines have been told to stay home.

In particular, the logical positivist philosophy is a deadly poison which I ingested during my Ph.D. training at the Economics Department in Stanford in the late 1970s. It took me years and years to undo these effects. Positivism uses clever arguments to make you deny what you feel in your bones to be true, and make you believe what your heart says must be false – for example, our supposed knowledge of subjective probabilities of unknown events. The roots of the problem go back to the famous Cartesian argument that “I think therefore I am”. Although it is clever piece of logic, it has a deadly effect. I know that I am alive because I can feel the blood flowing in my veins, the tingling of my skin, and a thousand other bodily sensations. “I feel therefore I am”. Denying this experience as a valid source of knowledge reduces me to a brain floating in a vat, which is exactly what logical positivism entails. In fact, despite Descartes, it is impossible to reason our way to certainty. We can only create an illusion of certainty. Descartes’ argument is deeply flawed, and illustrates the weakness of human reason. When we formulate the concept of “I”, isn’t existence automatically part of this? Did I not exist when I was a baby, and was unable to formulate these thoughts? Do I blink out of existence when I go to sleep? If someone has a hard time grasping philosophical concepts, is his existence thereby of a lesser quality? This and many other difficulties make this argument incoherent.</p><p>Modern economics is much like this. It starts by making assumptions which are dramatically in conflict with everything we know about human behavior (and firm behavior) and applies mathematical reasoning to situations where it cannot be applied, quantifying the unquantifiable and coming to completely absurd and ridiculous conclusions. Nonetheless, speaking from personal experience, the brainwashing is powerful and effective. It is a slow and painful process to undo. I have often thought about launching a “Positivists Anonymous” club, to help others attempting the same transition, of unlearning positivism.Based on my own experiences and difficulties in unlearning, and also the experiences of Keynes and many others who have unsuccessfully battered the gates of the citadel of neoclassical economics, I have come to the conclusion that this is a hopeless task. We do not expect to be able to convert the economists. This revolution will not be televised. Our only hope is to work on an external revolution – take the message to outsiders, not to economists. [Recent surveys show that despite the collapse and rejection of positivism in philosophy, economists continue to think in positivist terms.] Even among non-economists, the collateral damage done by positivism and by neo-liberal thinking, is immense.This article is a preliminary examination of the difficulties in making a paradigm shift; that is, I will not discuss the major second step of what an alternative paradigm could be, and how we could create and promote it. Awareness of these difficulties is necessary for those who attempt to launch a revolution, since we need to create converts to a new paradigm. Economists are hopeless as a target audience, but even non-economists will be tough nuts to crack if our message is radical. This is because economic frameworks have become widely accepted – witness the popularity of Freakonomics. Nonetheless, it seems necessary to make the effort to save humankind from impending catastrophe, not just on the environmental front, but on many others as well.</p><h3>Ask Your Professor:</h3><h4>How does climate change factor into our study of economics?</h4><p><strong>The necessity and difficulty of shifting our economic paradigms:</strong></p><p>In the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, the failure of economic theories, and of economists, to provide any warnings, analysis, or remedies, became glaringly obvious to all. The Queen of England went to the London School of Economics to ask “Why did no one see it coming?”</p><h4>Are the self-organizing principles of markets that have emerged over the past 300 years, in conflict with the self-organizing principles of ecosystems that have evolved over the past billion years?</h4><p>The US Congress constituted a committee to investigate why “economics, a field that <em>aspires to be a science</em>... (but)... generally accepted economic models inclined the Nation’s policy makers to <em>dismiss the notion that a crisis was possible</em>.” General discontent with economics has been captured in books too numerous to list; as a small sample chosen at random, consider Steve Keen’s <em>Debunking Economics: The Naked Emperor of the Social Sciences</em>, Joe Earle, Cahal Moran and Zach Ward-Perkins: <em>The Econocracy: The Perils of Leaving Economics to the Experts</em>, and Phillip Pilkington: <em>The Reformation in Economics: A Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Economic `</em>.</p><h4>Should we slow down fast money with a Robin Hood Tax?</h4><p>Many leading economists have expressed serious dis-satisfaction with the profession as a whole. John Cassidy’s article “After the Blowup...” in <em>The New Yorker</em> describes his interviews with apostates from the Chicago creed. Krugman wrote that the “Profession as a whole went astray because they mistook the beauty of mathematics for truth.” David Romer wrote that economists’ “dismissal of fact goes...(so)... far beyond post-modern irony” that it should be called “post-real”. He wrote that the profession has been moving backwards, losing precious insights gained. Olivier Blanchard, Chief Economist at IMF writes that DSGE models make “assumptions profoundly at odds with what we know about consumers and firms”. This is just a small sampler; we can easily find many other similar statements from leading economists, and practitioners intimately involved with finance and central banks on a global level.</p><h4><em>What do you think of Herman Daly’s idea of a steady state economy?</em></h4><p>Many leading economists have expressed serious dis-satisfaction with the profession as a whole.

In the phase he calls “normal science”, a fixed paradigm is applied to solve problems of explaining phenomena and manipulating the world via experiments. However, sometimes progress in knowledge occurs through a second type of event called “scientific revolution”, when an existing paradigm is overthrown, and replaced by a new and different paradigm. Paradigms represent ways of looking at the world, with frameworks, concepts, axioms, and methods. Different paradigms are incommensurable – terms in one paradigm are meaningless in another. For example, while the term “just price” was meaningful to scholastics, it has no meaning within a neoclassical framework. One cannot achieve paradigm shifts by arguments, since concepts and terms of a new paradigm make no sense in terms of the old paradigm. Instead, what is required is to put aside one way of looking at the world, and attempt to understand another way of looking at the same world. It is this putting aside – unlearning the old ways – which creates the greater part of the difficulty in achieving paradigm shifts. In the familiar picture below, when the person looking at the young woman describes the old lady’s eye as an “ear”, those fixated on the old paradigm consider this as crazy. As Keynes put it, “The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.” It is only by laying aside one coherent way of looking at the world that it becomes possible to visualize alternatives.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f189c4621f9e627414a4392_Beautiful-Young-Old-Crone.jpg""></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Even though Keynes succeeded in escaping from the old ideas, most of his contemporaries and followers never did. Phenomena which were central to Keynesian analysis in his “General Theory” were never understood by mainstream economists, trapped by the mindset created by conventional economic training. As noted by many, the Samuelson-Hicks interpretation of Keynes in terms of the IS-LM analysis has very little in common with the ideas of Keynes. This mis-interpretation of Keynes which is widely known as Keynesian economics today, rejects at least three of the central insights of Keynes. Briefly, these are the failure of neutrality of money, genuine uncertainty about the future (as opposed to risk), and the consequent essential role of un-anchored expectations in driving the economy. That is why Keynes said that “I am not a Keynesian”. He expressed his frustration at the inability of his fellow economists to follow him: “The classical theorists resemble Euclidean geometers in a non-Euclidean world who, discovering that in experience straight lines apparently parallel often meet, rebuke the lines for not keeping straight as the only remedy for the unfortunate collisions which are occurring. Yet, in truth, there is no remedy except to throw over the axiom of parallels and to work out a non-Euclidean geometry.”</p><h4>Why is there nothing about Islamic economics in our curriculum?</h4><p>In order to progress, it is necessary to pay more attention to WHY it is so difficult to make the transition from a Euclidean world to a non-Euclidean world. To understand this difficulty, we have to first unlearn a widely believed mistaken conception of logical positivists about observations and facts. The Logical positivists, building on a widely accepted Western philosophical tradition, regarded “observations” of what is out there as facts of experience, objective, free of doubt and ambiguity, equally available to all, and verifiable by all. Obviously, this fails if what we observe is due to an interaction between the objective and unique reality out there, and our subjective frameworks which we use for perception of this reality. As the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states, and as amazing modern physics establishes beyond doubt, the act of observation affects the behavior of that which is observed. But to take an easy to understand example, whether we see the young lady or the old lady – note that we can only see one of the two at any one time – is clearly determined by our subjective framework, and is not part of the picture.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1440px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1440px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f189c608d73e326afa901de_Student-Sitting-On-Sidewalk_bw.jpg""></div></figure><h4>I wonder . . .<br>is this profession I’m getting into ... a cold, theoretical game<br>or ... a profoundly personal discipline that goes to<br>the heart of who we<br>are as human beings?</h4><p>Even though the point is almost trivial, it is of vital importance for what follows, so let me amplify and explain further. When a baby is born into the world, his eyes and ears are assaulted by a rich range of sensory impressions, which make no sense and have no meaning. Exactly the same sensory impressions become very meaningful and clear as learning takes place, which allows him to parse sounds, and to process visual data in images of three dimensional objects. Obviously, our internal processing equipment is of central importance in the process of assembling observations into a three dimensional image of the world around us. Another way to think about the same thing is to consider the problem of computer vision. All a computer camera sees is a flat bit stream of colored points. This binary matrix of data on visual sensory input, must be resolved into a three-dimensional image. A HUGE amount of programming, which relies on knowledge of the environment, is required to be able to process this data and convert it into an image. The child learns to see objects and hear and parse sounds on the basis of experience, which constantly rewards correct parsings and punishes failure to visually comprehend the environment. A famous Stanford experiment showed cats brought up in a vertically striped world were unable to see horizontal stripes. Similarly, children brought up with languages with unusual sounds learn to discriminate and hear intonations and consonants which can never be heard by others in different linguistic environments, where such sounds are not present. This shows that our experiences can fix the frameworks we use to see the world beyond the possibility of change.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1440px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1440px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f189c756a728a78fa0aa826_Combine-Harvester-in-Tan-Fields.jpg""></div></figure><p>The outcome of all this discussion can be summarized metaphorically by saying that we all use glasses to see the world. The direct world out there is a jumble of sensations – a matrix of points – which makes no sense by itself, and must be interpreted using our own frameworks, represented by the glasses. This means that ALL observations are tinged with subjectivity, and interpreted within the frameworks created by our past experiences, successes and failures, in viewing the world.A paradigm shift occurs if we remove the glasses we use to view the world, and instead put on a different pair of glasses. A famous experiment conducted by Professor Theodor Erismann, of the University of Innsbruck put reversing glasses on his student and assistant Ivo Kohler. It caused extreme disorientation and discomfort at first, but after about a week of stumbling around, he adapted to this new way of seeing the world. His subjective interpretative equipment learned to interpret the reversed image by performing an additional reversal within the brain to arrive at a correct image of the world. Now, when the glasses were removed, the world appeared to be upside down to Ivo. On a much larger scale, this is what happened in Europe due to the Great Transformation which transformed traditional society to a market society, where everything is viewed a commodity for sale. Later, these ways of thinking were spread throughout the world by colonization and Western education. We learned to value everything according to its market price, and forgot that the most precious things cannot be purchased. Then it became easy to kill a million children, and destroy entire nations for corporate profits.</p><p>We can now understand the extreme difficulty of creating a paradigm shift. For those who have spent lifetimes learning to see the world with a specific pair of glasses, these glasses become melded into the flesh, and are impossible to remove. After failing to convince his contemporaries about his Quantum theory, Max Planck disappointedly realized that science progresses one funeral at a time. Thomas Kuhn also noted that paradigm shifts do not occur by converting those faithful to the old paradigm, but by inducting the young into the new worldview. Unlike the older generation, for younger and more flexible minds, it is possible to take off glasses manufactured in the Euclidean factory, and put on non-Euclidean glasses. Nonetheless, it is still a disconcerting and uncomfortable experience, which will not be undertaken unless there is some expectation of a great reward for this struggle and sacrifice. The costs of this paradigm shift must be paid upfront – one loses the ability to talk to the mainstream when one describes the world using an alien framework. The rewards are in the future, and highly speculative and uncertain. Nonetheless, for reasons explained elsewhere, it seems essential to make the effort – the survival of humanity is at stake.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f189c8652f9e53dd06223fb_aral_seaBig.jpg""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Asad Zaman is a professor, social scientist, and economist.

She splatters sex and expectations and reality with jet-black wit and stark bare boner-ness (Lucasian pun intended) and dares to take it all not so seriously. “It’s really just serendipity most of the time,” Lucas told Eileen Kinsella of artnet. “I think often deeper meanings tend to slip in—more in a Freudian slip sort of way. I’m always in a cloud of emotions and reading a lot, but I don’t directly try to put that into things. It’s more that there is a cloud of awareness.

Those sessions put me back on my feet when I felt like they were slipping out from under me. Slipping on the leftover mucus of eggshells. I was attending therapy (to grossly oversimplify) because I was sick of shrinking myself and my body, of walking on eggshells around people—specifically men. Life had taught me it was best to tiptoe around males in authoritative positions so that “who I am is constantly precluded to make room for someone else’s fragility.” That’s the way my friend put it one evening in a coffee shop, so succinct that I burst into tears, head drooping over my Americano.

The Caribbean island populations finally stopped paying tribute because they had disappeared: They were totally exterminated in the gold mines, in the deadly task of sifting auriferous sands with their bodies half submerged in water, or in breaking up the ground beyond the point of exhaustion, doubled up over the heavy cultivating tools brought from Spain.

The accelerating exploitation of fossil fuels throughout that era shifted the process into overdrive, allowing a minority of the Earth’s population, not only to adopt what were, by the standards of all other human societies, extravagantly lavish lifestyles, but to be able to expect that those lifestyles would become even more lavish in the future.</p><h6>John Michael Greer, <em>The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</em>, New Society Publishers</h6><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5fb594acb998d27770c5802e_slavery_600x414.jpg,The Haitian Revolution began as a slave revolt in 1791.

It’s the most human of feelings: to share the surging emotion of rage or delight that just lit you up.</p><p>A delicate alchemy has to occur for a viral moment to happen. There’s an element of luck. The avocado falls from the tree when it falls. You can’t really engineer a viral moment because the engineering mindset doesn’t know how to create magic.</p><p>But if you look at a lot of viral social moments in history, something was present in the run-up to them: ritual. And a ritual CAN be created.</p><p>It starts with a small gesture that sends a message in a visceral way. A bunch of guys throw crates of tea overboard into Boston Harbour, or, two centuries later, make a show of burning their draft cards on a New York City street. The gesture resonates. It is the avocado falling, and that expression of discontent just … goes viral.</p><p>Sometimes the ritual is a sit-in. Often it’s a march – on Washington, on Montgomery, across India to the Arabian Sea.</p><p>You coin a slogan that plucks the strings of the zeitgeist: Black Lives Matter. MeToo.</p><p>You play with the primitive forces of darkness and light – extinguishing the Eiffel Tower, Taking Back the Night, howling at the moon.</p><p>Rituals galvanize people, get them moving in lockstep, get them thinking in tune. Rituals drive protest movements.</p><p>When a ritual grows big enough, wide enough, it can go critical, like the chain reaction in the core of a nuclear reactor or bomb.</p><p>This is the most powerful tool the Third Force has: the ability to create a global ritual. Like Buy Nothing Day. Or Occupy Wall Street. One that can scale, cross borders, mean what you want it to mean.</p><p>A global ritual can change the course of history.</p><p>We the people need to learn to make it happen, to shepherd an eruption of spectacular discontent — and then level it up to a global phenomenon.</p><p>In the Spanish-speaking world, everyone knows the ritual of the cacerolazo (literally, “stew pot”) — a show of resistance tracing back half a century to when food shortages were widespread. You make a hellacious noise banging a spoon on a pot as a way to say: “We will not be silenced.” Last March they did it Brazil against regime of Jair Bolsonaro; in Spain, against the suppression of women’s rights. In Colombia, the casarolazo was repurposed against the new foe, COVID-19, to rail against inadequate government support during the lockdown.</p><p>“We’re hungry!” it said.</p><p>Now, some of us are hungry and a lot of us are pissed. So we too pick up a pot and a spoon, to meet this moment we’re in.</p><p>And it is a moment.</p><p>Occupy Wall Street went viral because conditions were perfect. Arab Spring had happened. Mubarak had been deposed. Greedy bankers had crashed the financial markets. Young people couldn’t get jobs. The 99 percent was furious at the 1 percent. And along came a lightening rod for that discontent: OWS. And the people’s movement that galvanized around Zuccotti Park but fed off proxy energy from around the world: that was the birth of the Third Force.</p><p>That same alchemy of conditions is in place now. A massive, destabilizing discontent is brewing. The avocado is damn near ready to fall.</p><p>When the US pulled out of Saigon, America lost its authority with the world, and a long period of soulsearching ensued that never really went away. When the US pulled out of Afghanistan in August, the other shoe dropped.</p><p>In October, leaders from 200 countries will converge on Glasgow for the UN Climate Change Conference. This was deferred a year by Covid. In the meantime, the screws tightened on humanity. A global code-red emergency was announced. Wildfires raged. The dry tinder of social upheaval is in place.

Philip Morris, Monsanto, GM, the Sackler family, Exxon Mobil: the list goes on and on.

People just can’t imagine a corporation like Exxon or Goldman Sachs being gone. When Lehman Brothers actually did fail — and many others came within a whisker of it — there was mass disbelief, chaos in the markets. A world without them simply doesn’t compute.

Ignore for a moment that Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008 for $31 billion has made the corporation the biggest player in the placement of advertisements on other people’s websites.

Humans played chess against computers for the fun of it and even beat them until recently, right?</p><p>Except that the companies you’re up against, the ones engaging in high-frequency trading (HFT) are playing a different game — one that no retail investor has the opportunity to play. The bots are buying and selling stocks multiple times a second. In theory you’re at the poker table with them but the bots are really playing each other — and the edge they’re chasing is now measured in nanoseconds — billionths of a second.</p><p>So investing isn’t about investing anymore — you know, looking for promising companies and supporting them to the level of your risk tolerance. It’s about hardware and software. This is an arms race: and the table’s tilted toward the companies like Citadel that have the money to build the fastest uplink closest to the stock exchange — to push their trade through a nano-whisker ahead of everyone else. And in fact most observers think the arms race will soon become a space race, with big players jockeying to colonize lower-earth orbit with necklaces of hundreds or even thousands of satellites so that one will always be close enough to get their “buy” or “sell” signal in there first as they shoot money across a dozen global stock exchanges and unofficial “dark pools” of high-volume speculation — leaving earthbound punters with their lasers and fiberoptic cables in the dust.</p><p>About three trillion dollars a day is generated this way – more than is generated any other way — and it’s making a few cowboys insanely rich as they fleece everyone else in the casino.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>The “so what” is that all these trillions of dollars aren’t actually doing anything. High-frequency trading creates nothing of actual value. It’s the ultimate financial circle jerk — a massive-scale transmogrification of money that means nothing. Except this whole thing is a ticking time bomb, and when it goes off we’re all going down like we almost did in 2008, or worse.</p><p>*</p><p>There is a solution here. It’s simple but not easy.</p><p>It’s a “hold” rule.</p><p>You put a legally mandated time gap between the trade and its acceptance. So when someone buys a stock, they have to hang on to it for some period of time before they can sell it again. Let’s say it’s 24 hours.</p><p>Now people start looking again at what it is they’re buying. The actual value of the stock, rather than simply its role in the spasm chain of money-begets-moneybegets-money.</p><p>Nanotrading: gone. Insider trading: severely curtailed. The intercontinental spectacle of money rocketing between exchanges in North America, Europe and Asia: hobbled.</p><p>A Canadian trader Brad Katsuyama tried to level the playing field in just this way — albeit much less radically. In 2016 he started his own stock exchange, which put a 350-millisecond “speed bump” in the way of the ultrafast turnarounds of the space cowboys. If you place and cancel an order in less than a third of a second, the order is canceled. Katsuyama met huge pushback from New York and London and Brussels, but also an outpouring of gratitude from pissed-off investors — and the New York-based exchange, called IEX, grew: it now accounts for around 3 percent of US trading volume.</p><p>So right there is proof of the appetite for a new, fairer field.</p><p>But a third-of-a-second speed bump is not enough to push the bots out of the game.</p><p>A one hour or 24-hour hold is better: You buy it, you keep it for a day.

Endless, mindless dissipation had become endemic, and it was killing not only our wallets but our culture, our souls, our planet. Something had to be done to take back power from corporations, to send the message that the spending public had woken up. Hence the one-day challenge to “participate by not participating.”</p><p>A handful of years later the 24-hour purchase-free protest was rescheduled to fall on Black Friday, the all-American consumption blitz. Riding the wave of an early viral campaign, soon the annual shopping moratorium was being observed in over five dozen countries. And then things went from a single date to a whole sea son: Buy Nothing Xmas was brought to bear to on the emptiness and waste of the modern yuletide holiday.</p><p>Now the Buy Nothing meme has undergone a further mutation . In over 6,500 Facebook groups representing hyper-local communities across 44 nations , millions now live by its tenets not just once a year but every single day. Among themselves they share tools and utensils, clothing and food, toys and travel mugs, hand-made goods, hand-me-downs and everything in between. Buying, selling, trading and bartering are all strictly forbidden. It’s a network of generosity, a “gift economy” whose members are bidden to “give from [their] own abundance.” Welcome to a cashless, wireless, wasteless world, a version of Buy Nothing for the social-media era.</p><p>Covid had no small part to play in its rise. Around the time of the Great Indoor Migration of 2020, Buy Nothing’s Facebook-based offshoot saw a sudden surge in interest. Something about the intimacy of previously handled objects, about the gesture of fulfilling a fellow-resident ’s need for baker’s yeast or toilet paper made it a popular salve for the loneliness and strain of the pandemic season. Amid economic free-fall it also proved to be a refuge for solidarity, a place to foster fellow-felling among those similarly hard-up . For many, it was their very first glimpse of anything to do with Buy Nothing.</p><p>From a single day to a season-long tradition to a daily habit — from print posters to the Web to the palm of your hand — Buy Nothing has evolved from a crazy idea to a widely practiced way of life. Here we have a textbook example of what the Third Force can achieve. No leaders, no capital, no outside meddling: with nothing but numbers and the spark of a great idea, it has revolutionized the lives of millions — and potentially the warming world.</p><p>After three ever-growing generations of Buy Nothing, what will the fourth look like? Will it dig deeper, move further, learn quicker, adapt faster? Can it be wielded with force against climate change? Wherever it goes, the meme’s future can’t be predicted with linear thinking and pattern-based predictions. Only the spontaneous creative will of the people, with the most powerful tool ever invented nestled in their pockets, can point the way forward. Could Buy Nothing 4.0 even play a part in putting humanity onto a sane sustainable path? We’ve only got so long to find out. It’s time for heads to bump — and for the Third Force to surge into action!</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/61803181e24439152b0c7b21_buy_nothing_day_600x692.jpg,"Nearly three decades ago a neat little idea called Buy Nothing Day was born in Vancouver, BC.

Yet faced with the prospect of capitalism actually ending, the most common reaction – even from those who call themselves “progressives” – is simply fear. We cling to what exists because we can no longer imagine an alternative that wouldn’t be even worse.</p><p id="""">How did we get here? My own suspicion is that we are looking at the final effects of the militarization of American capitalism itself. In fact, it could well be said that the last 30 years have seen the construction of a vast bureaucratic apparatus for the creation and maintenance of hopelessness, a giant machine designed, first and foremost, to destroy any sense of possible alternative futures. </p><p id="""">At its root is a veritable obsession on the part of the rulers of the world – in response to the upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s – with ensuring that social movements cannot be seen to grow, flourish or propose alternatives; that those who challenge existing power arrangements can never, under any circumstances, be perceived to win. To do so requires creating a vast apparatus of armies, prisons, police; various forms of private security firms and police and military intelligence apparatus, and propaganda engines of every conceivable variety, most of which do not attack alternatives directly so much as create a pervasive climate of fear, jingoistic conformity and simple despair that renders any thought of changing the world, an idle fantasy. </p><p id="""">Maintaining this apparatus seems more important to exponents of the “free market” than maintaining any sort of viable market economy. How else can one explain what happened in the former Soviet Union? One would ordinarily have imagined that the end of the Cold War would have led to the dismantling of the army and the KGB and rebuilding the factories, but in fact what happened was precisely the other way around. This is just an extreme example of what has been happening everywhere. </p><p id="""">Economically, the apparatus is pure dead weight; all the guns, surveillance cameras and propaganda engines are extraordinarily expensive and really produce nothing, and no doubt it’s yet another element dragging the entire capitalist system down – along with producing the illusion of an endless capitalist future that laid the groundwork for the endless bubbles to begin with. Finance capital became the buying and selling of chunks of that future, and economic freedom, for most of us, was reduced to the right to buy a small piece of one’s own permanent subordination.<br></p><p id="""">In other words, there seems to have been a profound contradiction between the political imperative of establishing capitalism as the only possible way to manage anything, and capitalism’s own unacknowledged need to limit its future horizons lest speculation, predictably, go haywire. When speculation did go berserk, and the whole machine imploded, we were left in the strange situation of not being able to even imagine any other way that things might be arranged.

The rest is term papers and advertising.""</strong> - Dave Hickey</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>The smartest guy in the room was also the biggest smartass. Harvard and Yale — both places he taught at – were the kind of clubs he wasn’t sure he wanted to belong to. He accepted a MacArthur “genius” grant while remaining deeply suspicious of the word. Nothing in life matters more than beauty, he insisted — even while scarfing hamburgers and living in Vegas. He pissed off people on both ends of the political spectrum, calling himself, at various times, a “bleeding heart libertarian,” and an “egalitarian elitist.” He said what it wasn’t safe to say until everyone else was saying it too (or at least thinking it).</p><p>There’ll never be another cultural critic like Dave Hickey — who died on November 12 at age 81. And that is exactly the kind of claim he would call bullshit on. What you can say about Dave Hickey is that he matters because art matters. Maybe now more than ever.</p><p>All revolutions are aesthetic before they’re anything else. Taste is power, and power is politics . . . so taste has enormous power to shape history. “Picasso, Pollock and Warhol changed the world because they re-ordered preferences,” Hickey said.</p><p>From his perch way outside the establishment (like Diogenes the Cynic, living on lentils so he wouldn’t be beholden to the king), Hickey watched the culture re-order its preferences, sculpting and resculpting itself. Art is happening all over, in real time, and if you just look for it in galleries you’ll miss most of it. He saw no real distinction between a Mondrian painting and a Dr. J jump shot: if it makes your scalp tingle, it’s art. “There are people who treat Raphael as graffiti, and people who treat graffiti as Rafael,” he said. “I prefer the latter.”</p><blockquote>“Bad taste is good taste,” he said, “and good taste is just the residue of someone else’s privilege.”</blockquote><p>*</p><p>He was the scat poet of literary criticism — his style was inspired, he claimed, by Chet Baker’s trumpet solos. (Hickey liked jazz because jazz exemplifies the possibly doomed experiment of being totally free, with others.) He wrote in bursts of observation that glowed with gonzo radioactivity. Old-school, yes, but somehow new-school too, in tune with the 140-character pulses sent daily by the billions into the Twitterverse. (Hickey saw the Internet for what it is — a double-edged blade. “If you’re on social media, you are not making good art or, at least, not enough of it . . . ”)</p><p>He kept a pied-a-terre in his head, but he lived mostly in his body. This is a guy who once played guitar with Janis Joplin and first encountered Robert Mapplethorpe’s work in a coke-dealer’s apartment. Leave it to other critics to deconstruct the reasons why people find things beautiful; Hickey just let beauty land. We feel first, and then the head kicks in; if the order is reversed, something’s wrong — with the art, or with us. All stabs at technical perfection — from the drum machines of the ’80s to the Auto-Tune that gives everyone a shot at a top-40 hit today — are stupid. Real art is messy. Order sucks. When you just miss the target, you usually end up somewhere closer to the truth.</p><p>We forget that art is a fundamentally social thing, or should be. It draws us out of our silos to stand in front of it and talk. In that give-and-take we’re energized; but no stranger has an answer to our predicament. Hickey’s famous essay “The Heresy of Zone Defense,” about basketball, was embraced by many who don’t care a lick about basketball. Because it wasn’t really about basketball — it was about life. It’s a team game we’re playing, here, but ultimately, we must all improvise a personal solution as the shot-clock runs down. The noblest thing, maybe, is simply showing up. “The missing are presumed dead.”</p><p>*</p><p>Hickey had a theory that all people are either pirates or farmers. “Farmers build fences and control territory; pirates tear down fences and cross borders.” He himself was a pirate. All artists are supposed to be pirates, but too many of them have become farmers.</p><p>Over the decades he watched money and celebrity warp the contemporary art world — the overexposed stars, the gallery owners pimping their wares to rich collector/investors — to the point he wasn’t sure he wanted any part of it.</p><p>So he walked away.</p><p>That was a decade ago.</p><p>Now, as his pal, the Pulitzer-Prizewinning art critic Jerry Saltz put it, the “exquisite nomad and ripening beast” has left the building altogether.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/62422131fa0e629135d43a62_dave_hickey.jpg,"The smartest guy in the room was also the biggest smartass.

We have to ridicule their axioms in campus newspapers and on campus radio . . . organize teach-ins and, in front of campus-wide audiences, demand to know how they factor forests, fish, climate change and ecosystem collapse into their macroeconomic models. We have to create a collective aha moment of truth when it becomes obvious that the professors in charge of educating the next generation of economic policy makers are unable to answer even the most fundamental economic question of them all: How do you measure progress, Mr. Professor?

In the half-century since the release, and prompt two-decade ban, of <em>Titicut Follies</em> (1967) — his harrowing début about a prison for the criminally insane — Wiseman has chronicled the myriad ways (chiefly) American life is raised up and laid low, dignified and debased, spared and squandered by institutions. With bald titles such as <em>High School</em> (1968), <em>Welfare</em> (1975), <em>Near Death</em> (1989), and <em>Zoo</em> (1993), and with runtimes often reaching into the hundreds of minutes, his films may strike the uninitiated as dry, cheerless, even gruelling. To so presume, however, would be to overlook the rare offerings of one of modern life’s keenest cinematic observers — one whose gaze fixes with as much care on the inner workings of institutions as on the hidden hands which make them tick.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/607491026c335b2d60e69796_frederick_wiseman_450x605.gif"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>As a rule, Wiseman abstains from the techniques of persuasive filmmaking, not least because his “films are not didactic,” as he insists. “In fact, they’re the very opposite of didactic.” No talking heads, no interviews, no voice-over, not so much as a glimpse of the man behind the camera feature in the span of a single frame. All that is forsworn in the interest of capturing raw, unhampered reality. Yet despite his staunch avoidance of artifice, his editor’s bag of tricks might well hold the subtlest of them all. “What I construct in the editing is a fiction,” he told me in early December. Taking 30 seconds here, a minute and a half there, “I then edit it together so that it appears as if it took place the way you’re seeing it, when it didn’t.”</p><p>Wiseman spoke to me on the phone from Paris, where he spends at least half of each year. His voice is husky and low, his cadence even and precise. Occasionally breaking into wry tones, he expresses himself with the ease of someone long steeped in his craft, and happily so. His appetite for work seems boundless: normally, it’s what gets him out of bed in the morning, and occupies him well into the evening. “I like to work hard,” he states plainly. “I can work till eight o’ clock at night, and either go to the theatre or I can work till nine, nine-thirty at night and go to a good restaurant and meet my friends.” The pandemic, however, has proved a dampening disruption to such industrious habits. “It’s the first time in 55 years that I haven’t been working on a film,” he laments. “I’m bored out of my mind! I’m bored and I’m scared, because the virus likes people my age.” He turns 91 on New Years Day.</p><p>“Good prose is like a windowpane,” George Orwell <a href=""https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/"">believed</a>. That is, in service of truth, “one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one’s own personality.” Unseen and unheard, Wiseman strives in kindred fashion after a strict fidelity to facts. “I have a responsibility to the people who give me permission … to make a film that accurately reflects what I found there,” he maintains. This rigorous commitment to accuracy is what determines the exhaustive span of a movie like <em>City Hall</em>, which clocks in at over four-and-a-half hours. “If the film comes out at the length I deem is appropriate for the material, then people can watch it, or distribute it, or show it on television as they wish,” he affirms. “But it’s basically take it or leave it as it’s made.” While it may scare off the squeamish (the likes of whom may nevertheless, <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/frederick-wisemans-ex-libris"">in Anthony Lane’s words</a>, “binge-watch the entire second season of ‘Mr. Robot’ over a weekend without breaking a sweat”), this uncompromising approach offers a singularly immersive experience to those who stand to endure it. “It may not work for everybody,” Wiseman concedes, “but if it works, the viewer comes out of the film feeling they’ve learned something about the place and its complexity.”</p><p>This is certainly true of <em>City Hall</em> (2020). The institution of the title is Boston’s, and the film’s leading man, so to speak, is Mayor Martin J. Walsh. The camera follows Walsh, and the many unnamed civic employees who serve under him, as they undertake the unglamorous task of running a great American city. Walsh appears at press conferences, charitable events, functions, town-halls, Q&amp;As — a plethora of meetings, both private and public. (“The quintessential Wiseman scene,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/movies/city-hall-review.html"">in Manohla Dargis</a>’ eyes, “is the meeting.”) Notably, he carries out his office with a minimum of pomp. He speaks to his working-class background, his childhood bout with cancer, his struggles with alcoholism, and his regret over remarks made on the campaign trail, all with a politician’s tact and yet with remarkable candour. By way of a team of dogged agents, his administration addresses poverty, racial equality, workers’ rights, tenants’ rights, immigrants’ rights, accessibility, education, health care, seniors’ care, and the preservation of the city’s history, among a roster of progressive preoccupations. Meanwhile, garbagemen take out the trash, firemen put out fires, police discuss recent crimes, and citizens dispute parking tickets as they would in any other metropolis. One gets the sense that, regardless of politics, a city like Boston runs not on glory but on grunt-work.</p><p>Whereas the goings-on in Boston are marked by quiet professionalism, those in Washington are all bluster and breakage. Likewise, if Walsh — or rather, the assemblage whose figurehead is Walsh — comes out in the hero’s corner, then the film’s villain is none other than the 45th president. Invisible but unshakable, Trump looms like a ghoul, an all but perfect foil to Walsh and his plain-dealing operation. Not that Trump is so much as disparaged in the film. Rather, that he is so seldom and tentatively invoked makes his absence all the more conspicuous. Merely by carrying out his duties with a modicum of competence, Walsh seems to embody the very opposite of what hasn’t so much characterized as eclipsed governance at the federal level over the past four years.</p><p>Yet according to Wiseman, no political point of any kind lies behind <em>City Hall</em>, nor any of his other films. When I asked him whether a kernel of activism lies at the heart of any of his work, he replied, firmly, “No.” Though he doesn’t object to his films’ being used for activist purposes, “they’re not made with that in mind.” Although it provoked outcry, <em>Titicut Follies</em>, for example, “doesn’t advocate any solutions; it presents the place as it is.” Herein lies the point. “One of the things about making these kinds of movies,” he makes plain, “is that, just by the luck of being in the right place at the right time, you come across so many different aspects of human behaviour. This,” he emphasizes, “is really the subject of the films.”</p><p>Indeed, it’s Wiseman’s careful eye for people that accounts for the most moving sequences in his films, conjuring flashes of the sublime out of the grotesque and the mundane, the haunting and the heartening. <em>Titicut Follies</em> is framed by an absurd song-and-dance number performed by inmates bearing pom-poms; they are led by the prison’s wide-grinning warden, whose domineering self-regard makes one wonder just what distinguishes him from his fellows behind bars. The dull despotism on display in <em>High School</em> is interrupted by a teacher’s reading the lyrics of a Simon &amp; Garfunkel song to her class; its “superficial sighs” light up a habitually sullen face or two with a glimmer of poetic recognition. For the benefit of her immigrant peers, a mother recounts the chilling ordeal of her daughter’s northerly passage across the Mexican border in <em>In Jackson Heights</em> (2015), sparing no appalling detail in the course of her unabridged, nearly ten-minute account. For its searing vividness — as with Bibi Andersson’s carnal disclosure in Ingmar Bergman’s <em>Persona</em> (1966) — one is left feeling as if one has actually seen the story take place, rather than merely heard it told.</p><p>If a prevailing sensibility can be said to stamp Wiseman’s work, it’s his adherence to frankness. Bureaucracy, spite, neglect, and prejudice mark many modern lives; so do fellow-feeling, solidarity, live music, and Pride parades. (May it all come back soon.) Considered together, Wiseman’s films capture an ample portion of this teeming, unvarnished variety. Not that they betray a fixation on his part in any way cynical or prurient. Errol Morris dubs his friend “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/magazine/frederick-wiseman-documentaries.html"">the king of misanthropic cinema</a>” — which, with all due respect, is a gross mischaracterization. What kind of Scrooge ends a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_xL_tsBtZ0"">three-hour paean to finding joy in hardship</a> with anything as life-affirming as fireworks bursting to the full-throated wailing of a toothless tita, as Wiseman does in <em>In Jackson Heights</em>? That he sometimes dwells on the unsavoury aspects of life doesn’t make him an incurable downer. Rather, like a friend standing steadily by one’s side, come what may, it makes him a sympathetic witness to the truth of human experience in its many colours, drab and lurid. From the grandest to the humblest, each part has its lines to deliver; its noteworthiness lying not in its prominence but in the vim with which it is played out. Under Wiseman’s direction all are sure, at the very least, to get the uncommon chance to gain an audience. It’s up to the viewer to look on with as big a heart.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/607491026c335b2d60e69796_frederick_wiseman_450x605.gif," Frederick Wiseman's latest documentary, City Hall, is his forty-third, but who’s counting?

It was 2016. My mother had died the year before, and I was wandering around Mexico alone trying to fill the hole her death had left. Through serendipity and talking to the right people, I met a local anthropologist, Ramón Martinez-Coria, and ended up in his car on the way out of the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas to Zinacantán, a Tzotzil Maya town nestled within the mountains of Chiapas.</p><p id="""">‘Zinacantán’ in the Nahuatl language means “land of the bats” and ‘Tztozil’ means “people of the bat.” It’s one of those places where you feel like you could reach out and touch the cheek of a God. The sky speaks in thunder. The mountains would move if you asked them right. &nbsp;And surely, if you were to breathe out a prayer in smoke, some gods would hear you.</p><p id="""">If you look at a map of Zinacantán you’ll see a mess of wiggly lines. Just down the road is the city of San Cristóbal, which is a patchwork jumble of grids laid at odd angles to each other. When Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas arrived in the 16th century, he attempted to resettle the Tzotzil Indians into orderly towns with grid-patterned streets to teach them about God, as if it would be impossible in such disorderly mountain hamlets. As soon as the priest left, the people went back to their mountain “<em id="""">parajes.” </em>Just as the crucifix killed the spirit of Christ, the straight lines of the grid-iron city have the ability to kill the spirit of a place.</p><p id="""">***</p><p id="""">One of the fundamental tenets of geometry is that the shortest way to connect two points is a straight line. The quickest way to get anywhere is to cut a line straight through the middle of a landscape; blow a tunnel through the mountain, cleave a stripe through a forest, connect the banks of a river with a bridge. The straight line is a statement of political authority and the power of man to dominate a landscape. City blocks are laid like tiles on a kitchen floor. There is no differentiation in the standardized blocks for residential space or public space or commercial space. On a street map, it all looks the same.</p><p id="""">In the construction of any human settlement, we will often first look for a natural intersection, the confluence of rivers, a crossroads; a natural point from which to recreate our universe. If no point exists, then we create one. The grid layout of early settlements has appeared across the world at different times in history; from Babylon to ancient Athens. The Greeks used Euclidian geometry in their attempt to de-animate the landscape - they worshipped the right angle and the order it brought onto land.</p><p id="""">But nowhere is it so prevalent as in the not-so-sacred geography of almost every North American city. They are monumental odes to the straight line. Salt Lake City in Utah is a grid system of perfect squares arranged with the Mormon church at Temple Square at its dead centre. The city’s numbered streets start from there and it marks the border of east and west sides of the city.</p><p id="""">There is no logical end-point to a grid-pattern; they’re designed to keep expanding. And expand they did. In 1573, King Phillip II of Spain compiled the Laws of the Indies which guided the construction and administration of colonial communities, specifying a square pattern to any new city planning. Under this tenet, hundreds of grid-plan communities throughout the Americas were established, from Anchorage to Buenos Aires. It was seen as the model of a civilized, rational way of housing humans.</p><p id="""">The grid-pattern allowed for the systematic subdivision and allotment of vast swathes of stolen land. A grid maximises the use of land for real estate value, and it’s easier to hold under centralised military control. In order to control a population, the powerful would split up the land and sell it in postage-stamp parcels. The Land Ordinance of 1785 divided the United States into square townships that were further subdivided into standardised lots for re-sale by settlers and land speculators. It reduces the urban to a place of the profane.</p><p id="""">***</p><p id="""">The pervasiveness of right-angled geometry is so great that it’s hardly ever questioned. Except, perhaps, when a European finds herself in Vancouver for the first time. After six months in Vancouver, my cognitive map is pretty much a straight line along Broadway between the University of British Columbia and East Van, with a few escapades north or south. A gridded city makes it easy to navigate when you’re new somewhere, but it renders detours almost impossible. Rebecca Solnit tells us that there’s another kind of depth achieved in meandering. “You’re not trying to get somewhere else, but to know where you are,” she writes.</p><p id="""">The great Romanian philosopher of religious thought, Mircea Eliade, suggests that every human has, “the desire to find oneself always and without effort in the Centre of the World, at the heart of reality.” Perhaps this goes some way to explaining the modern city’s rigid architecture: buildings rise like fingers out of the land, ever-reaching towards the sky; streets arranged at ninety-degree angles push the horizon into the distance; endless crossroads mark each intersection as a new centre of reality. If you’ve ever been to New York, you’ll know how it feels to be in a place that thinks of itself as the centre of the world. Everyone acts like it is, and so it feels like you’re in the most important metropolis on the planet.</p><p id="""">Arguably, New York has the most famous street map in the world. But Manhattan’s street-map didn’t always look like a chessboard. In the early 19th century, comic writer Washington Irving described New Yorkers like this:</p><p id="""">“Tossed about on hills and dales, through lanes and alleys, crooked streets whisking off at tangents and left-angle-triangles, just like their own queer, odd, topsy-turvy rantipole city, [New Yorkers] are the most irregular, crazy-headed, quicksilver, eccentric, whim-whimsical set of mortals that ever jumbled together in this uneven, villainous revolving globe,”</p><p id="""">Philadelphians however, blessed with living in a gridded city, “talk like a book, walk mathematically, never turn but in right angles.”</p><p id="""">The 1811 Commissioners’ Plan for New York City, developed by a handful of influential New York men, transformed Manhattan’s ancient hills, dales, swamps, springs, streams, ponds, forests, and meadows, into the most famous cityscape in the world. The island was levelled and forged anew in a gridiron. The surveyor general, a man named Simeon De Witt, believed that such empirical rationalization of the landscape would “discipline the mind” of New York’s settlers. No wonder, I think to myself, while walking through Vancouver’s rectilinear monotony, that I feel like a transplanted organ unwelcome by the host body.</p><p id="""">But the orthogonal geometry of a North American street-map is now deeply ingrained in our expectations of how a city should be. Without its fearful symmetry and the guiding post of compass points, we are lost. Any time there’s a blip in the pattern we’re lost. Have we been deprived of our ability to wander aimlessly like the flâneurs of Paris? &nbsp;The Aboriginals in Australia have song lines across the landscape. The Kogi in Colombia weave the fabric of the universe through their movements. City-dwellers walk in straight lines, so we don’t get lost.</p><p id="""">Our globalized world has more straight lines than ever; in its national borders, longitudes and latitudes, streets and rail roads, we see a manifestation of the Cartesian co-ordinate system inscribed on the landscape. Enlightenment freed us from religious tyranny, but now we live in a land management system inspired by the myth of endless growth, productivity, and individualism. If geography determines destiny, our destiny is to trace straight lines ever forwards. The pre-destiny written into our city plans is the fundamental philosophy of <em id="""">progress</em>. On a clear day, we can see miles ahead of us. Modern time is linear, our history runs straight from day zero, and our navigation is as the crow flies. Organizing chaos like the gods before us, we need straight lines to feel human.</p><p id="""">***</p><p id="""">You won’t find a single organic object on this earth that takes the form of a straight line. There are perfect circles, spirals, wonks and wiggles, but nowhere in the natural world will you find two intersecting lines in symmetry. Look at the roots of a tree, woven within a vast underground network in a tangle of arteries, veins and capillaries. In defiance of nature’s squiggles and curves, we claim order through building our realities in straight lines and grids. It is all about control. Humans are born in disorder - the whole point is to bring order to existence. Only through our conscious meddling can the world become manifest.</p><p id="""">Where are the sacred points in the most habited places on earth? Maybe we can create small interruptions of the sacred in our profane cities. People are starting to reclaim city space through ‘tactical urbanism.’ They’re re-wobbling the lines with guerrilla gardening, de-paving, chair-bombing. <a href=""https://landezine-award.com/park-instead-of-parking-the-white-flowers-boulevard/"" id="""">Parks</a> instead of parking.

The patchwork jumble of grids isn’t something you notice at the street level. You’re too distracted by the colours of the clothes that seem unnaturally bright, the way the women’s plaited hair is tied-off onto itself, and the smell of fresh nixtamalized corn tortillas. But if you walk away from the centre, the city gives up and shrugs off its attempt at right-angled organization, turning instead to the wild lazy lines of mountain paths.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/62c4ad602192996921b68c02_bored_in_the_city_600.jpg,"It was in the backseat of a white pickup that I learned about the people of the bat.

They built their empire on a business plan to sell toxic addictive products to people who didn’t know any better. They were literally getting away with murder and had been for decades.</p><p id="""">That’s the moment I started to hate corporations.</p><p id="""">“Hate” may be the wrong word.

Hook the customer early and squeeze a lifetime’s worth of profits out of them — and when regulators close in, you shift your focus to the developing world where the rules are looser and you target those kids.</p><p id="""">I thought: How can a company like that even be allowed to exist?</p><p id="""">That rage bubbled on the back burner for years. I didn’t really know what to do with it. Until the day in 1991 when Richard Grossman walked through the door of Adbusters.</p><p id="""">He asked if I had a few minutes to chat.</p><p id="""">Richard was a lawyer and a legal researcher. He’d spent the last decade immersed in American history, connecting the dots of corporate ascendance. He knew where the bodies were buried.</p><p>Richard spoke softly, with the quiet authority of someone who has done the work. There was something about him that was totally free. He was tracking to true north, his mission as tightly defined as marching orders, and as large as the future of democracy itself.</p><p>Corporations, he said, were “worms in the body politic.” (He talked like that.) They are nothing more than “legal fictions” and we the people need to redefine our relationship with them. We have to change the way we speak and even think about them.</p><p>People have no idea how insidious corporate culture is, Grossman said. It sculpts the personalities of consumers, encouraging the very traits Americans claim to hate: self-censorship, low aspirations, soul-crushing conformity.</p><p>And then he told me a tale that would change my life and work at Adbusters. Call it The Unofficial History of America.</p><p>The official history of America is one every kid knows. It’s a story of fierce individualism and heroic personal sacrifice in the service of a dream. A story of hungry settlers carving a home out of the wilderness. A story of a revolution, beating back British imperialism and launching a new colony into the industrial age on its own terms.</p><p>It’s a story of America triumphant. Of its rise after World War II to become the richest and most powerful country in the history of the world, the land of the free because of the brave, an inspiring model for the whole world to emulate.</p><p>The unofficial story of America is quite different.</p><p>It begins the same way — in the revolutionary cauldron of colonial America — but then it takes a turn. A bit player in the official story becomes critically important. This player turns out to be not only the provocateur of the revolution, but in a sense its saboteur.</p><p>The corporation.</p><p>We tend to think of corporations as a fairly recent phenomenon, the legacy of the 19th-century robber barons. But they were front and center in pre-revolutionary America. They had a beachhead before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock; the language of their charters is in the DNA of the Constitution. The Virginia Company of London, the Massachusetts Bay Company, the British East India Company: these were the Amazon and Wal-Mart and Google of their day.</p><p>But back then our dealings with these behemoths were very different. The colonials were highly suspicious of them. They recognized the way British kings and their cronies used them as robotic arms to control the affairs of the colonies, to plunder resources and bring them to the motherland.</p><p>The colonials pushed back. When the British East India company slapped duties on its incoming tea (and they had the colonials over a barrel; that’s how monopolies work), well, you know that story. Radical patriots protested, ships were turned back at port and 342 chests of tea ended up in the salt chuck.</p><p>The Boston Tea Party gave young America a glimpse of its own strength. Self-determination was starting to seem not just possible but inevitable.</p><p>The Declaration of Independence freed America not just from British rule but also from the tyranny of British corporations, and for a hundred years Americans remained deeply wary of corporate power. Corporate charters were granted very selectively and for a specific purpose. Limits were set on how big and powerful a corporation could become.</p><p>Even the enormous industry trusts proved no match for the state in those early years. Antitrust legislation kept their appetites in check. Corporations couldn’t participate in the political process. They couldn’t buy stocks in other corporations. If they stepped out of line, the punishment could be severe. Charters could be revoked and some were. In 1832, the state of Pennsylvania found ten banks to be acting against the public interest and wiped them out of existence.</p><p>The people — not the corporations — were in control.</p><p>So what happened? How did corporations come to wield more power than the individuals who created them?</p><p>The shift began in the last third of the nineteenth century — the start of a great period of struggle between corporations and civil society. The turning point was the Civil War. Corporations made huge profits from procurement contracts. They took advantage of the disorder and corruption of the times to buy legislatures, judges and even presidents. President Lincoln foresaw terrible trouble. “Corporations have been enthroned,” he warned, shortly before his death. “An era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power will endeavor to prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the people . . . until wealth is aggregated in a few hands . . . and the republic is destroyed.”</p><p>Nobody listened. Corporations continued to roll. They had the laws governing their creation amended. State charters could no longer be revoked. Corporate profits could no longer be limited. In hundreds of cases judges granted corporations minor legal victories, conceding new rights and privileges.</p><p>Then came a legal event that would not be understood for decades (and remains baffling even today), an event that would change the course of American history. In Santa Clara County vs Southern Pacific Railway, a dispute over a railway route, the U.S. Supreme Court deemed that a private corporation was a “natural person” under the U.S. Constitution and therefore entitled to protection under the Bill of Rights. Suddenly, corporations enjoyed all the rights and sovereignty previously enjoyed only by people.</p><p>Santa Clara was nothing less than a corporate takeover.</p><p>It’s still widely considered one of the great legal blunders of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Corporations employed 80 percent of the workforce and produced most of America’s wealth. They had become too powerful to legally challenge.</p><p>Many of the original ideals of the American Revolution had been quashed. America was being ruled by a coalition of government and business interests. The shift amounted to a slow-motion coup d’état — a gradual subversion and takeover of the institutions of state power. Except for a temporary setback during Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal (the 1930s), the U.S. has since been governed as a corporate state.</p><p>Today, corporations have nearly all the same rights as people: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, religious liberty, due process, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to counsel and the right to trial by jury. They freely buy each other’s stocks and shares. They lobby legislators and bankroll elections. They manage the flow of information, set our economic and cultural agendas and grow as big as they damn well please.</p><p>We the people have lost control. Corporations, these legal fictions we ourselves created two centuries ago, now rule over us. And we accept this as the normal state of affairs. We go to corporations on our knees. Please do the right thing we plead. Please don’t cut down any more forests. Please don’t pollute any more lakes and rivers (but please don’t move your factories and jobs offshore either). Please don’t use pornographic images to sell fashion to my kids. And please don’t addict them to your algorithms. We’ve spent so much time bowed down in deference we’ve forgotten how to stand up straight.</p><p>The unofficial history of America, which continues to be written, is not a story of rugged individualism and heroic personal sacrifice in the pursuit of a dream. It’s a story of democracy derailed, of a revolutionary spirit suppressed, and of a once-proud people reduced to servitude.</p><p>Richard Grossman had literally been pacing around the office as he laid all this out. “Two narratives,” he said. “The difference between them is the difference between a country that pretends to be free and one that truly is.”</p><p>“It’s time to make a tactical leap, change the way we grant charters to corporations and take our country back!”</p><p>On that day, this mild-mannered visionary set a new agenda for our fledgling NGO and beyond.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/64a47cbb8c345a44fa99bef4_history%20of%20america.jpg,"In high school the cool kids smoked.

Horrors become recognizable as such only when they are remembered and recounted. “Others,” whether seeming or actual, become familiar solely through the telling of tales that bridge like with unlike. And stories — <strong>powerful, enduring stories</strong> — are surely impossible to craft without language.<br>Language is among the defining achievements of the human species. It alone enables ideas to make the near-impossible leap from one mind to another. It is the medium of our weightiest thoughts. Without this genius for sharing thoughts, humanity would be no different from any other ape: the absence of language would mean no stories, which would mean no culture, which would mean no memory, which would mean no identity. We are bound up in the narratives that we claim as our own, and in the words that we use to tell them.

It is the horror of a language decimated to the degree that thought itself becomes impossible outside ideologically permitted limits. In the novel, an all-ruling party-state (“Ingsoc”) decrees ever slimmer official dictionaries, with the aim of replacing traditional English (“Oldspeak”) with its barren bastard, “Newspeak.” “The purpose of Newspeak,” wrote Orwell, “was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible”:<br><br>It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought — that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc — should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. … This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever.<br><br>To that end, words such as “<strong>free</strong>” could no longer mean “<strong>intellectuallyfree</strong>,” or “<strong>freeto speak,</strong>” but could be used instead only in contexts such as “This dog is free from lice” or “This field is free from weeds.” Words such as “bad” were eliminated completely (and replaced with vile contortions such as ungood). Other terms — thoughtcrime, doublethink, Big Brother, and memory hole — endure in the (somewhat paradoxically) enriched English language of reality.<br>Though based on the totalitarianism to which he bore witness during the twentieth century, Orwell’s insights are no less relevant to the twenty-first. Today’s parlance is riddled with inanities such as “<strong>alternative facts</strong>,” “<strong>post-truth</strong>,” and “<strong>fake news.</strong>” They have replaced the following perfectly good, honest descriptors: “lies,” “lying passing as a normal and respectable habit,” and “lies told by the (real or purported) media,” respectively.<br>Even the once objective notion of abstract numeracy is under threat. Patently false yet doubly defended claims of Donald Trump’s having drawn “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period” bring to mind the absurd doublethink phrase “<strong>two plus two equals five</strong>,” belief in which is enforced by Ingsoc to demonstrate complete and slavish and arbitrary obedience to the Party’s doctrine. Nineteen Eighty- Four’s protagonist, Winston Smith, wonders whether widespread belief in the slogan is proof that it is true despite his misgivings. This fallacious logic is typified by Trump’s redoubled justification for racist comments made on Twitter (wherein he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen “go back” to “the crime infested places from which they came”): that “<strong>many people agree</strong>” with his sentiments.<br>Winston correctly noted the danger of this sort of thinking. “<strong>Freedom</strong>,” he noted, “<strong>is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows</strong>.” The barbarity of the tyrant is made plain by his linguistic savaging of truth. The first sign is the disappearance and bastardization of words.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f07953c10a80c326c9af4e7_5e61706994c904079f914324_semi-colon_300x573.jpeg""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>ENEMY No. 2: Sinister Euphemisms<br></strong><br>In his essay “<strong>Politics and the English Language</strong>,” Orwell took issue with writing “designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind”:<br><br>[P]olitical speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. … Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism … Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification.<br>Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is <strong>called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers</strong>. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is <strong>called elimination of unreliable elements</strong>. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.<br><br>It is thus that Venezuelan “<strong>Operations for the Liberation of the People</strong>” have resulted in the unlawful torture and murder, at the hands of death squads, of thousands of civilians. It is thus that Chinese gulags for the suppression of ethno-religious minorities are termed “<strong>re-education</strong>” centres. It is thus that xenophobia, intolerance, and supremacy masquerade as “<strong>heritage</strong>,” “<strong>tradition</strong>,” and “<strong>pride</strong>.” It is also thus that refugees are derided as “illegal aliens.” Furthermore, it is thus that the current climate crisis has, without much complaint, come to be known more mildly as “climate change,” and its deniers as “skeptics” — as if to imply that “change” might not be so urgent after all, and that deniers’ claims differ justifiably (instead of ignorantly) from the scientific consensus.<br>In the same essay, Orwell wrote that “[w]hen the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.” Similarly, for the “atmosphere” (here, meant both metaphorically and not) to improve, language must also be saved. To that end, insidious euphemisms must be outed for what they truly are: attempts to slyly make that which is intolerable seem tolerable.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f079555e1da773536e7a40f_5e6177528436bc81a1f4dd2e_censored_360x119.jpeg""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>ENEMY No. 3: Censorship<br><br></strong>Freedom dies in silence.

Cliché is the thoughtless regurgitation of received ideas. To that end, cliché is among the ultimate instruments of ideology. In his study of “brainwashing” in Communist China, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton wrote that “the language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché”:<br><br>The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. They become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.<br><br>Here, we find the intentions of Newspeak fulfilled. When language — the medium of thought — becomes reduced in its scope to a predetermined set of stock phrases, all independent and original thinking becomes impossible. All critical, all free thinking becomes impossible. This is the first decisive step toward unfreedom.<br>Hannah Arendt wrote in Eichmann in Jerusalem (the book that birthed the notion of “the banality of evil”) of how, at his trial in 1961, titular Holocaust-organizer and Nazi war-criminal Adolf Eichmann confused the presiding judge with his inarticulate manner of expressing himself:<br><br>Dimly aware of a defect that must have plagued him even in school … [Eichmann] apologized, saying, ‘Officialese … is my only language.’ But the point here is that officialese became his language because he was genuinely incapable of uttering a single sentence that was not a cliché.<br><br>And of his inability to communicate at his trial:<br><br>… Eichmann, despite his rather bad memory, repeated word for word the same stock phrases and self-invented clichés … The longer one listened to him, the more obvious it became that his inability to speak was closely connected with an inability to think … No communication was possible with him, not because he lied but because he was surrounded by the most reliable of all safeguards [i.e., clichés] against the words and the presence of others, and hence against reality as such.<br><br>Finally, writing of then-common but specious “explanations” for the horrors of the Third Reich:<br><br>All these clichés have in common that they make judgment superfluous and that to utter them is devoid of all risk.<br><br>If the association of clichés with one of the twenty first century’s most abhorrent criminals (and two of its most ruthless regimes) is not quite enough, consider the following (softened) clichés: “immigrants are criminals and rapists,” “people of Middle Eastern origin are terrorists,” the same “wish to instate Shariah law in the West,” “non-white people wish to ‘replace’ the white race,” and so on. Most inflammatory, resentful, hateful, and generalizing rhetoric (in short, the open endorsement of ignorance) can be reduced to slogan like clichés — again, according to Lifton, “brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed.”<br>By “simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in,” Orwell wrote, clichés can “construct your sentences for you — even think your thoughts for you.” A language that is reduced to clichéd, bumper-sticker slogans is not the equal of thought — it is its pure, unmitigated opposite. And an unthinking person is the ideal vessel for corrosive, wrongheaded — and, yes, dangerous — ideas.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f07957b8f37f3ce1b63af8e_5e617c778436bca5a1f4ed7e_3_dots_360x119.jpeg""></div></figure><p><strong>ENEMY No. 5: Cynicism<br></strong><br>Cynicism is lazy fatalism dressed up as rational skepticism. The very nonchalance of the cynic betrays his apathy; it absolves him of any responsibility to act. “Why bother,” he says, “when there is nothing to be done that is worth doing?” Yet this is never true: there is always something to be done — however small the act; however dire the circumstances.<br>To be a cynic is to concede to the forces of wrongdoing. If a despot cannot successfully con you (for despotism necessitates an abuse of confidence), or if a naysayer cannot doom-and-gloom you into submission, then he can at least hope that you will give in to cynicism that is, to resigned passivity. “The government’s fucked. There are no viable alternatives. Why even vote?” “The planet’s fucked. Why not have a good time of it?” “The culture’s fucked and there’s no fixing it. Why participate in society at all?” No one who, in the face of adversity, has ever made significant change for the better has thought (except in moments of doubt) in this way. And many a cynic has abetted — whether unconsciously, indifferently, or secretly — the very wrongs that comfortably confirm his pessimism.<br>Cynicism belies fear: a cynic is too reluctant to stand for anything because, out of trepidation, he cannot think or act with conviction. Sunny, naïve idealism and the motivation to act are not synonymous; optimism necessitates hard work, and the tenacity to act in the face of overwhelming odds. Cynicism, however, demands nothing but the assurance and safety of renounced responsibility. It is the reaction of the shut-in.<br>Moreover, cynicism justifies ignorance. “If nothing that can be known can change anything, then why bother knowing anything?” The same trite manner of reasoning infects everything in the eyes of the cynic. “There is nothing so pitiful,” said Maya Angelou, “as a young cynic because he has gone from knowing nothing to believing nothing.” To the cynic, everything — honesty and dishonesty, good and bad, facts and lies — is flattened to the same plane. The cynic’s ignorance allows him to believe nothing because he ignores the facts that would show his dismissive platitudes to be unfounded in — or rather, contrary to — the truth.<br><br>The integrity of language (and, by necessity, of truth) is facing a trial of hazards. Yet, if history offers any indication, language, and its ability to communicate the truth, have shown remarkable resilience, even if at times they have threatened expiry or been rendered dormant. It is a testament to the seeming will of truth that it has managed, like so many stubborn weeds, to crop up in the most hostile and unexpected of places, at the most inopportune of times (for its enemies). But this does not exempt any one of us from vigilance.<br>A phrase that dates from the Watergate scandal’s fraught days for truth (and which now serves as The Washington Post’s motto) bears repeating: “democracy dies in darkness.” Better yet: democracy dies in silence. If we cease to vocally defend the freedom of language, we will see a waning in the vitality of truth. Then, unfreedom will have its day. So, to prevent this day from ever following night, it is essential to take stock of the truth’s wellbeing and its safeguarding in a robust language. The brutal reality in which we find ourselves begs a brutal aesthetic to match: the aesthetics of resolute, unwavering truth.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5e9625f5c2f96acbc6ad87e2_words_blackboard_featured_600x300.jpg,"Brutal days, to be resisted, often demand brutality inkind.

A favorite newspaper columnist had some wise words that touched on the subject. But what we had experienced was personal; no one could offer a completely adequate explanation. In fact, our investigations quickly complicated matters. It seemed as though the possible factors worth considering stretched across the world, arced back through history and reached deep into countless people’s minds. There was even a vague intimation that we ourselves could have been responsible in some way for the developments leading up to what had taken place today. </p><p id="""">Our thoughts became divided. The difficult process of understanding was weakening our resolve to rise to the challenge of the moment; at the same time, it seemed immoral to act on a fading sense of certainty. We still had a long way to go to fully understand all the dimensions of this problem at its roots. But how long could we stand around and analyze and re-analyze? We felt as though we’d been walking around in a dreamworld, and that the shock today had shaken us awake. We could see, now, that we were living in the middle of a crisis. Self-doubt seemed like a form of surrender. Even if it meant acting with limited knowledge, we had to do something. Shadows were even now spreading across the streets. </p><p id="""">From this point on, fear of the imagined future would be the foundation of our actions. We would have to trust ourselves. We quickly reviewed the facts and opinions we had been putting together. Ideas that fell too far outside our norms were dismissed; the potential consequences were too extreme to imagine. The most honorable plan seemed to be to find a middle ground consistent with our past opinions and actions – it was these, presumably, that had led us to our insight in the first place. Abandoning the pattern of beliefs that had guided us through life to this point would be self-sabotage. </p><p id="""">We prioritized. We promptly put aside those lingering questions that could take days or even years to fully explore. We threw out ideas that we knew would isolate us in our community, or that might get us fired. We simply ignored any insights that required more consideration or baffled our sense of rationality; the most compelling ideas were those for which there were well-known, pre-existing arguments and easily understood rationales. Internal cohesion and commitment were vital. </p><p id="""">Even as we moved towards a sense of certainty, however, we felt simultaneously anxious about the time it was taking and distraught about the haste with which we were cutting off our internal debate. At the same time, other issues – the need to get winter tires on the car, and to feed the crying baby – began to press in on us. Irritability began to outweigh earnestness. We had to figure this thing out. </p><p id="""">Finally, we settled on a reaction – or at least a preliminary position. We had a case that we could argue and defend in the coffee room or a letter-tothe-editor; we had a starting point for personal change, maybe a little more volunteer work. </p><p id="""">At exactly this instant, without confessing it aloud, we remembered the astounding openness of our initial reaction, its almost infinite sense of possibility, and saw how quickly we had spiralled into impotence and murk. </p><p id="""">The whole world had changed. And we had returned to life as usual. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/6309326ac4a11b353e6a20e2_jenny_woods_593.jpg,"We were standing in the street, half-way home from the day job and momentarily distracted by a good-looking parking cop, when it happened.

People jostled and bustled, busier than on the holiest of holidays. Gossip was the only entertainment in my remote village. The favorite subjects were horses, dogs, and women. The latest juicy topic stirred their bored souls to life.</p><p>On my way home from school, I heard them chortling. Men spoke at the public places, and women addressed passersby from the doorways.</p><p>“Have you seen her? I hear she’s beautiful,” one woman clucked, holding a child in her arms.</p><p>“I saw her. She is a desirable beauty,” added another.</p><p>“You two harp on about her beauty, but what has it gotten her?” a third woman knotted her wrinkled hands and said, “Her looks have made her nothing but a slave. Bangladesh defamed Pakistan, and now this Bengali girl will malign our village. May Allah save us.” She drew a prayer symbol.</p><p>“Speak low. The Khans’ boy is coming,” one cautioned and nodded her head at me. A sly smile crawled across her face as I approached.</p><p>I listened intently but pretended indifference. They lowered their voices. I was twelve but my parents didn’t like my interest in the adult world. I guess the woman also doubted my innocence. Deleir was my uncle, so I was curious to know. I looked back after passing them, and they had resumed their animation.</p><p>Outside the mosque, at the center of the village, a group of graybeards sat under the wide- spread branches of a banyan tree. Heavy smoke plumes drifted from their hookahs, spiraling in the air. I heard much of what they said. Talk of Deleir Khan’s libido filled through the smoke-laden air, as loud in my ears as their smoke was heavy in my nose. Had I been further away, I would’ve bet the banyan tree was on fire. To avoid them, I took a different route. I saw Bhola, the madman, sitting with his back to the mosque pillar. He raised his hand to stop me. I shuddered at seeing his jagged black fingernails, as the flies swarmed him like rotting fruit.</p><p>“What is that?” He pointed to the inscription on a wall.</p><p>“Allah’s the greatest.” I stammered.</p><p>“Yes, but beware of His men.” He put his hand down, allowing me to go. I picked up my pace until I reached the old brick street.</p><p>On the main street, I saw Ruboo riding the bullock cart. Old Man Ruboo, always gloomy and grumpy, was the most vocal of all. He stopped his cart at the front of a shop and climbed down, shouting, “Deleir Khan needs to set a standard instead of fucking around with a Bengali woman.” His controlled face of ugly disapproval would’ve frightened a wild pig.</p><p>Nasty jokes assaulted me as I hurried home. I passed two giggling girls who taunted me, “Hey, Mahi, congratulations on your new aunt—a Bengali aunt!”</p><p>Pushing through the front door of my home, I saw my mother sweeping.</p><p>I blurted, “Mother, is it true? Has uncle bought a Bengali woman?” I looked down at my feet, unable to meet her eyes.</p><p>“What?” Regaining her composure, she returned to sweeping. “Yes, your uncle has brought another wife home, that’s all,” she muttered and turned her face away, still blushing red.</p><p>So it was true, I had a new aunt! The thought of a Bengali aunt fascinated me. Determined to sneak a glance, I dashed toward the yard wall where a window provided a view of Uncle Deleir’s house. Mother blocked my way. “Go to your room and do your homework,” mother shouted.</p><p>I trailed off to the house and waited for father to return home.</p><p>The night grew colder, and I sat near the fireplace and gazed at the burning coals until late, watching the flames lick the brickwork. When father arrived, he sat quietly in his favorite chair. Perhaps he saw my hand tremble on the arm of the chair with my gaze fixed on the fireplace.</p><p>I gathered my courage to break the silence. “Baba, are wives for sale like animals?”</p><p>“Who told you that?” His voice felt sharper than any blade.</p><p>“Everyone in the village says Uncle Deleir has purchased a Bengali wife.”</p><p>“Well, your uncle may need a woman to take care of his new mare. You know, animals bond with some people and can’t live without them. I think this might be the case with your uncle’s new horse.” I wondered whether father was not ready to accept her as his sister-in-law.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c50274d5db430fb8e8c1_horse-george-hiles-unsplash.jpg""></div></figure><p>He rose slowly, placed his hands on his hips and twisted side to side, and I heard his spine crunch like the pleasure of tired hands cracking knuckles. He walked to his bedroom, leaving me by the fireplace. I went to bed as well, but thoughts rushed through my head, driving sleep away. Uncle’s dog barked at midnight. Either the mare or the woman had upset the dog.</p><p>In the morning, I lingered over my breakfast, and loitered in the doorway, trying to postpone my departure for school. Stories of my uncle would have spread like horses fleeing fire, and I dreaded confronting my schoolmates.</p><p>At school, boys approached with a lot of lewd teasing. I avoided them, but during lunch break that proved impossible. I stared at the ground as I ate, hoping they would go away.</p><p>“Mahi, your uncle is a womanizer, never happy with one woman,” Lal, a senior student, said as he nudged me.</p><p>“Now, he’s brought a Bengali woman, for a new taste, fresh from the city,” Bakshu, Lal’s friend, added.</p><p>“I guess it runs in your blood, boy. You look like a Bengali-woman type of guy yourself. Grow up fast. We want to hear your stories, too.” Lal laughed and strutted away with his gang. His laughter rang in my ears as he left.</p><p>The rest of the day was no better; I longed to go home. My heart pounded from shame. Uncle’s new wife was the talk of the school, from the classes to the washrooms.</p><p>Days passed, and still I hadn’t met my new aunt. Life in the village fell back into its usual rhythm; the topic grew stale. My uncle soon moved her to a hut near the animal farm. A large Bokul tree shaded her hut which, with the arrival of spring, turned lush with tiny red fruit. The tree was home to a group of monkeys. She worked alone all day. No one referred to her by name. She was “The Bengali Woman.” She piqued my curiosity, but no one introduced us.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>One sweltering summer morning, I saw my Bengali aunt leading uncle’s mare, sheep, and goats out of his compound. Her black hair shone in the sun and waved in the slight breeze. Her dark clothes swathed like rags around bird-thin limbs. She was barefoot as she led the mare by the reins, yet she walked with grace.</p><p>Sheep were easy to lead. I knew them to be the most docile of creatures. But goats were another story. They reminded me of Old Man Ruboo, though not as ugly. The goats compliantly followed her. They trotted behind like faithful hounds instead of acting like the stubborn third cousins of mules.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c520bfc3543ef9e626bf_goat-maxime-agnelli-unsplash.jpg""></div></figure><p>There must be something special about this woman for her to have such an effect on the animals. I hurried to catch up.</p><p>When I got close, she looked down at me and asked, “Who are you?” Her gentle smile and musical voice made my heart beat faster. I had never seen such a woman in the village. Her dark eyes were radiant pools. I wanted to hug and welcome her, but formality forbade it.</p><p>“I’m Mahi, Deleir Khan’s nephew.”</p><p>“So, my nephew, too.” She smiled as she walked away.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>The school year ended, and summer vacation begun. Early one morning, I saw my new aunt leading the sheep to pasture. I noticed the dog that barked so furiously the first night now followed in obedience.</p><p>“Can I come with you, aunty?”</p><p>“Please do. I would welcome your company.” Her black eyes radiated warmth.</p><p>We strode from the village, towards the pastures. When we arrived, she opened her hand-woven mat and placed it under an old thick gum tree. The meadow extended up to the hills. The leaves sang melodies. She held out her hand and said, “Come and sit in the shade. Are you interested in horses?”</p><p>“A little. Do you know much about them?” I asked.</p><p>“Oh yes, I have a gift for getting along with most animals.”</p><p>Over the next hour, she taught me more about horses than I thought anyone could. I found myself smiling and nodding. The timbre of her voice made everything interesting. I began to understand the secret of her success with animals. Even I would be helpless but to obey that musical voice.</p><p>“Aunt, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Laila.”</p><p>“Oh, I have a cousin named Laila! I didn’t know it was popular among Bengalis, too!”</p><p>“That’s not my birth name,” the aunt laughed, “your uncle gave it to me when he brought me here.”</p><p>Confused, I scrunched my brow. “What was it before my uncle named you?”</p><p>She paused, staring at my uncle’s mongrel. Her eyes glistened. “I’ve had many names. I don’t think you’d understand even if I tell you.”</p><p>“I will. I’m no longer a child. I’m twelve years old.”</p><p>She looked at me with a bleak face. “I’ve had more than twelve names.”</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c542ba2e8323131b3501_sheepdog-echo-grid-unsplash.jpg""></div></figure><p>She got up to help the dog deal with a stubborn goat. I’d heard uncle grumble about what he called ‘That worthless mongrel. Don’t know why I even feed him.’ Yet now, after a few weeks with Aunt Laila, the worthless mongrel seemed to be a good sheepdog. The antics of the dog and goat made her laugh.</p><p>She returned with a beautiful mushroom in her hand. “You know it grows in wild soil. I’m like a mushroom.” Her voice was a whisper, her gaze soft and neutral. “It has no roots, no one owns it, and anyone can easily pick it. “</p><p>She gave me the wild mushroom. “If you put it on the fire for a minute, it’ll be ready for you.” Her gentle smile encompassed her eyes.</p><p>From that day forward, I never missed an opportunity to spend time with Aunt Laila. I was getting older, so I could make my own decisions, and my parents were busy tending our crops.</p><p>Aunt Laila and I became good friends. We spent many hours sitting in the shade, watching the sheep and talking. I felt a comfort in her presence I’d never felt before. Her poise and serenity formed an aura about her that drew the animals and me as well.</p><p>“Why did you make them your friends?” I asked, pointing at the livestock.</p><p>“Because they aren’t cruel. No hatred, no politics, no war and they don’t enslave their kin. Look at the dog, how he wags his old tail. Give him love, and in return, he’ll lick your feet.”</p><p>“But when we hate a person, we call him a dog or a bitch,” I replied.</p><p>“But some dogs still bite,” I said rubbing the old wound of a dog bite on my foot.</p><p>She smiled. “I wish all humans were more like dogs. They are simpler.”</p><p>“What about other animals?”</p><p>“All animals are better than humans. The more time you spend with them, the stronger the bond you form. Humans hate each other; they can’t live together for a long time.”</p><p>She called a young sheep over to us and stroked her wool.</p><p>“Soft, isn’t it?” said Aunt. “And what will we do with her? We will eat her to repay her for the love she has shown.”</p><p>The dog barked.</p><p>“A signal to go home,” Aunt sighed.</p><p>The dog led the flock homeward. We followed.</p><p>“Another day has gone.” Aunt looked toward the sun flickering like a dying candle.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>One day, as we sat with the flock, I remembered everything she had told me on previous days.</p><p>“Auntie, please tell me more about your life. Why have you had so many names?”</p><p>She gazed toward a small solitary white cloud floating in the vast blue sky. Tears brimmed her eyes. She dabbed her face on a shirt corner and glanced away. “I’m sorry,” she said.</p><p>“You don’t need to be sorry. I made you cry.”</p><p>The tears continued, but she smiled and reached for my hands. She began her story in her quiet, musical voice.</p><p>“I’m a daughter of poverty. My memories are also poor, ones I don’t want to keep, but they won’t leave. I was born in a small Bangladesh village near Dhaka, then a part of Pakistan. My father often spoke of Karachi, a city far away, but full of opportunities. He worked for a man who grew jute while mother worked hard, too. Almost every day, we walked with her to the river where she’d wash our clothes by pounding them on rocks. Meanwhile, I watched over Mousa, my younger brother, to make sure he didn’t go into the deep water. Sometimes, the jute would not grow because the rains had failed. Then, father would have no work, and my family would go hungry.”</p><p>“What happened next, Auntie?”</p><p>Regaining her composure, she wiped her eyes and resumed. “The summer I turned nine no rain fell, and father couldn’t find work for months. We had bread now and then, and once a week, he’d somehow procure beans. But it was never enough.</p><p>“Then, Mousa became ill. Mother tried her best to feed and comfort him. I tried to make him laugh and made funny faces. He could barely keep his eyes open. I’m not even sure he could see me.”</p><p>She paused again to wipe once more at her cheeks.</p><p>“One morning, he couldn’t breathe. I put my hand to his cheek. His skin was cold. It chilled me more than the early morning river. I screamed. My parents came running and tried to bring him back to life, but…” Her face twisted in agony.</p><p>“We had no money for a funeral. Father buried Mousa in the dry, rocky ground. Mother held me so tight. I was afraid of losing her. They each said a few words about how he would now be at peace in heaven. Our wails were enough to make the gods cry.”</p><p>Aunt Laila paused, as if continuing was too painful. But then she squeezed my shoulder and got up. She called out to the sheep, and we walked back to the village.</p><p>Neither of us broke the silence until we arrived. “If you wish, I’ll tell you the rest of my story tomorrow.”</p><p>“I would be glad to hear it.”</p><p>I went to bed eager for the morning.</p><p>At dawn, I awakened to sheep bleating. Fearing that Aunt Laila had left me behind, I dashed out the door. I met her by the hill that formed a natural boundary between the pastures and the village.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f18c55c50f85931952a64eb_sheep-xavier-teo-unsplash.jpg""></div></figure><p>“Your uncle told me that your parents object to you coming to the pasture with me. Perhaps they worry our friendship is becoming too close.”</p><p>“I’m able to choose my own friends. Besides, you are family. What could be wrong?”</p><p>She mussed my hair and spread her mat under the towering gum tree where we usually sat.</p><p>“Aunt Laila, will you continue your story, please?</p><p>She nodded. “Of course, just for you.” Aunt Laila closed her eyes and breathed deep. “Father had no work. One night, I heard him tell mother we would all die if we didn’t get out of that place. He told us about Karachi, a beautiful port city with lots of work. His cousin lived there who could find a job for Father. We started our journey from Dhaka to Karachi.”</p><p>She paused to collect herself, then continued. “We traveled on a cargo ship. It looked so small on the vast sea. We ate uncooked fish. Inside, the worst part was not the lifeless bodies rotting in the dark, or the buckets of urine stinging our eyes but the not knowing what waited for us at Karachi.”</p><p>Tears rolled down her cheeks. She didn’t speak for a few minutes. She smoothed her skirt and began again in a clear voice. “We took almost a month to reach Karachi. Father found a job at an old house near the port. Food was plentiful, but we never forgot the ocean.</p><p>“Our newfound life didn’t last. The movement to separate Bangladesh from Pakistan had spread hatred against Bengalis, and father lost his job. Hunger returned along with the spread of terror. Men murdered my father, mother, and cousin. But they spared me.”</p><p>“Oh, how terrible! How did you survive?” I asked.</p><p>My aunt closed her eyes and titled her head. “By satisfying their lust.” Her eyes opened again and drank in the blue sky as if trying to find her God.</p><p>“Since then, nothing’s changed. The first man soon sold me, and I’ve been purchased many times. Every buyer gave me a new name, to make me seem unsullied, I guess. Now I’m a wife to your uncle, and I may be the wife of another before long.”</p><p>There was much I did not understand about the intricacies of adult relationships. But I knew that my beautiful Aunt Laila had been hungry and hurt.</p><p>A song of a cuckoo at some distance brought me back. A faint glimmer of light flickered on the horizon, consumed by the approaching darkness within two heartbeats. That was the time for the wolves to gather amidst the shrubs and make their collective howl. We walked back to the village.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>A week later, I went to Uncle Deleir’s home for buttermilk. When I reached the front door, I heard voices coming from my uncle’s room. It sounded like my uncle was negotiating.</p><p>“Ten thousand rupees is my last offer. I bought her for fifteen thousand,” Uncle’s tone was firm.</p><p>“No, that is too much. She is no longer young,” the stranger replied.</p><p>I went to Aunt Laila’s hut, but she wasn’t there. I searched everywhere. I returned to my Uncle’s room and peeped into a crack to see inside. I saw her squatted in the corner.</p><p>The man took money out of his pocket, wrapped in a piece of cloth and gave it to uncle, who counted each note.</p><p>Uncle rose from his chair, grabbed Aunt Laila by the arm, and shoved her toward the man. Her head was down and her hands were clasped as if in prayer. She said nothing. She simply kept her head bowed, inhaling deeply. When the business was finished, they walked out, with Aunt Laila trailing behind the stranger.</p><p>“Aunt Laila, are you leaving?” My tongue felt heavy in my mouth. I reached out and held her hands.</p><p>“I’m no longer Laila.”</p><p>The dog licked her feet, and she reached down to pet him. The stranger ordered the woman, now nameless again, to follow. She trailed behind him.</p><p>“Aunt Laila, please don’t go. You are Laila. You are Laila to me.” I sobbed.</p><p>Startled, she ran back to me, bowed to me, and spoke through tears, “I wish you a lifetime of wisdom and love.” Her lips pressed together as if it would hurt to smile. But she managed a smile for me, though her eyes spoke of sorrow yet to come. “Mahi, remember me,” she said. “I was your friend.”</p><p>“Hey bitch, come back,” the stranger shouted with a look of disgust.</p><p>She kissed my head and hurried back to him, then turned and waved again. Her hand hung like a dove suspended motionless on a frail tree. Her eyes hooded with fear and sorrow.</p><p>The villagers came out to watch Laila leave. She left without looking back. I watched her disappearing. Lost. Alone. Abandoned. No human tried to rescue her. Only the dog chased the stranger. He barked viciously as if to stir the people’s conscience.</p><p>The mare neighed. Her sound was different. It shrilled like a scream, but it was not enough to put the humans around me to shame. My heart yelled.</p><p>“She will die soon because now she’s the possession of a cruel man.” Ruboo, the old man, spoke.</p><p>“Die?

It fell to his co-author, the archaeologist David Wengrow, to finish their collaborative tour-de-force and get it out into a world right when the world needs it most.</p><p>The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity, is a wholesale rewriting of the way we humans evolved and organized ourselves. To Graeber’s sweeping historical eye there’s nothing inevitable or “natural” about the unbridled free-market economy that we moderns ultimately decided is the horse to bet on. On the contrary, it’s an ugly distortion of the idea that arguably works best: a flatter, co-operative system where decisions are made collectively, and inequality is kept in check.</p><p>I have particular respect for books like this that attempt to blow things apart on a meta-level. Only the most brilliant, daring (and maybe foolhardy) attempt them. But these are the kind of coyote howls we need in the planetary endgame. Because systemic boldness like this has magic in it. A clearly articulated vision of revolutionary change can move people who are out of gas and out of hope.

While social media became a vaster and faster channel for news, papers’ print circulations and advertising revenues dwindled, forcing major newspapers to go online and many smaller, local ones to shut down entirely. “Between 1970 and 2016,” Jill Lepore wrote last year in the New Yorker, “five hundred or so [American] dailies went out of business; the rest cut news coverage, or shrank the paper’s size, or stopped producing a print edition, or did all of that, and it still wasn’t enough.”</p><p>As publications made the timely switch from print to pixels, it was rarely questioned that the very same information would cost nothing at all to be disseminated on the Web. But with Big Tech companies such as Google and Facebook making big money off the fruits of an imperilled news industry, further ensuring its decline — Google made $4.7 billion in 2018 from third-party news, as reported by the News Media Alliance, while paying news outlets barely a penny — that assumption is now being challenged.</p><p>Enter Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. “The digital platforms need media generally, but not any particular media company, so there is an acute bargaining imbalance in favor of the platforms,” Sims told The New York Times. “This creates a significant market failure which harms journalism and so, society.”</p><p>Sims’ agency is at the helm of a pioneering effort to force technology firms to pay for the lucrative news peddled until now for free on their platforms. “Global tech companies are not beyond national laws,” he said, “especially when there is so much at stake.” Draft legislation is set to be completed by July.</p><p>The proposed new laws could hardly come at a more urgent time. Amid huge losses of revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic, already-strained publishers worldwide have furloughed or laid off many employees simply to stay afloat. Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, News Corp, put a temporary halt to the printing of 60 community newspapers across Australia, according to the Australian Broadcasting Company. Meanwhile, Facebook and Google are making enormous profits as millions browse in self-isolation.</p><p>Could this signal a wider wave of enforced accountability for Big Tech? Governments from Europe to Asia have taken note, perhaps heralding new protections for the fourth estate. But whether the laws, when they arrive, prove enough, or too little too late, it is too early to tell. It’s time, at any rate, that digital platforms pay up.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f1749855a6e3d74919cbe2a_total_surveillance_phone_hand_540x532.jpg"" alt=""Total Surveillance""></div></figure><h4>The protection of human freedom can no longer be thought of merely as a matter of traditional civil rights, the rights to speech, assembly, and voting that we’ve usually taken as the bedrocks of a free society. What we most urgently need is something else: protection against widespread behavioral control and advanced propaganda techniques. And that begins with completely rethinking how we control the collection of data.</h4><p>‍</p><p>That will require not a privacy statute, as some might imagine, but a codified anti-surveillance regime. We need, in other words, laws that prevent the mass collection of behavioral data. Most people think that privacy laws are in place to do this, but existing privacy laws, including the European privacy law, have done little to actually slow down the collection of data. Instead, they supposedly give us more control over when data is collected and how it is used, which in practice just means pop-up notices and the placing of some limits on how data is used. None of this is bad, but it doesn’t actually prevent surveillance. There is a reason that Facebook says it welcomes European-style privacy regulation.</p><p>A real anti-surveillance law would accomplish something different: it would stop the gratuitous surveillance and the reckless accumulation of personalized data. It would do that by allowing only the collection of data necessary to the task at hand: an app designed to help you mix cocktails would not, for example, be allowed to collect location data. Gratuitous surveillance would be banned — and after collecting data, firms would be forced, by default, to get rid of it, or fully anonymize the rest of it.</p><h6>— Tim Wu, reviewing Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism in The New York Review of Books</h6><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f1749a5791dab4b53d40bd4_mlf_flag_draft_360x447.jpg"" alt=""Mental Liberation Front flag""></div></figure><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f17641b47235466d95ae08b_time_for_big_tech_to_pay_up_590x380.jpg,"Once called the “fourth estate” for its power, crucial to democracy, to check the three official branches of government — legislative, executive, and judicial — journalism has suffered a hemorrhage of resources since the advent of the digital era.

But have you caught wind of the 15-minute city?</p><p>“We need to transform the culture of proximity,” says Carlos Moreno, a professor at Sorbonne University. “People live with loneliness, anonymity and stress. This situation exists because [they] don’t have the time to develop local social links because of a hectic urban life.”</p><p>The idea is to redistribute the downtown concentration of shops, workplaces and recreational spaces, so that no urbanite has to travel — by foot or bike — more than 15 minutes to get anywhere they might like (or need) to go. In this scheme the cafe, the grocery store, the pharmacy, the hospital, the park and the jobsite are all to be found within a quarter-hour radius. Precious moments saved on commuting can instead be put toward family time, outings with friends, gardening, art, ritual bonfires — name whatever you love to do but don’t currently have time for.</p><p>When he first introduced it at COP21 in Paris, people scoffed at Moreno’s proposal for being too utopian. Then came Covid-19. The pandemic forced hundreds of millions of city-dwellers worldwide to shelter within their neighbourhood bubbles. In a sense, it imposed the fifteen-minute city as a mandatory social experiment. The results, for many, were revelatory. Moreno won the 2021 Obel Award for “outstanding architectural contributions to human development,” and since then not only Paris but Barcelona, Rome, Shenzen and Chengdu have all drawn up plans to implement some version of his plan.</p><p>“The 15-minute city is not a magic wand, or a market model,” Moreno insists. “It’s a new urban narrative. It’s a way of shifting the paradigm by basing development on temporal convergence and according to economic, social and environmental priorities, to create liveable and equitable cities.” Admittedly, it doesn’t do much to address the larger, systemic drivers of the climate crisis (namely, the suicidal logic of fossil capital). Facing that hydra-headed beast will require much more than greener, friendlier conurbations.</p><p>But Moreno certainly got one thing right. Undoubtedly, a sane sustainable future is <em>local</em>.</p><p>This kind of thinking can spread like wildfire. So go be the spark. Get a bunch of folks together and inspire your city council to push the concept. Talk the mayor into making the 15-minute city central to their long-term urban-planning vision.</p><p>If a thousand cities take the plunge, we’ll be well on our way to winning the planetary endgame.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/62b4cf0dfeeafe435a1ab672_15-minute_city_600.jpg,"“We need to transform the culture of proximity,” says Carlos Moreno, a professor at Sorbonne University. “People live with loneliness, anonymity and stress.

In the aftermath of WWI, Mondrian and the modernists weren’t just painting blocks of primary color, they were retreating from a physical world that had ceased to make sense into a realm of pure abstraction. They were pursuing the development of a universal language through which to express fundamental truths. And when the “war to end all wars” was succeeded by another, the abstract expressionists retreated even further from the external world, turning inward to search the collective unconscious for some sense of existential certitude. <br></p><p>What have our contemporary artists been giving us? For the most part, they’ve given us objects and empty forms – golden calves and diamond skulls. It’s the economic substructure of art – the underlying network of critics, curators, collectors and tenured academics – that has been imbuing our art with its meaning … and value.<br></p><p>Like everything else in our crumbling financial reality, the art we have lauded as the best of our age has been exposed for what it is – a number on a page that doesn’t represent any real wealth, an object on a pedestal that doesn’t represent any real meaning.<br></p><p>We can’t explore the possibility of developing a new aesthetic until we answer the question of what, if anything, will be the unifying philosophy of our age. If, as Erik Plambeck has suggested, we are destined to be a culture that measures success through a tally of Facebook friends and blog hits, then we have no impetus to collectively tap an undercurrent of meaning and truth. We will be content to live in a world of appearances, virtual successes and hollow forms. <br></p><p>But then again, maybe that’s a bit too pessimistic. Celebrated writer and critic Dave Hickey sees things differently. He has stood as a sentinel in the art world for decades and offers a sage observation on its rise and fall: “Good artists will make love among the ruins” he vows. “Good art will always take us by surprise.”<br></p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5fc6c6cde42254a73ed1b92b_ideally_this_image_would_be_straight_600x506.jpg,"Underlying any viable aesthetic movement is a broader philosophy, a loosely unifying worldview that connects the artists working within it.",—Sarah Nardi,Aesthetico,152,Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,,false,,,

During the pandemic we all got a glimpse of what this older, slower, deeper way of being might feel like, at scale. With your workplace shuttered, you went to ground with the ones you love. With nothing happening “in the world of sports” you stopped watching other people move their bodies for money, and started moving your own. With no new music dropping, you picked up an instrument and futzed out a tune. You baked stuff, sewed stuff, wrote stuff in ink, fixed stuff instead of “calling a guy.” For the first time in forever, you picked up a book. </p><p id="""">In Wichita, Kansas, a Gen Z kid – one of those neo- Luddites — wanders into the public library and finds, in the Classics aisle, the story of Diogenes. An ancient Greek philosopher who lived in a barrel and slept with dogs, he considered himself the last free man in the Mediterranean. He had nothing and, therefore, had everything. One day an acquaintance — a philosopher in fancy dress named Aristuppance — spotted Diogenes sitting on the ground eating a meager bowl of lentils. “You know, your life doesn’t have to be like this,” Aristuppance said. “If you’d just learn to be obedient to the king you would not have to live on crap like lentils.” To which Diogenes replied: “If you had learned to live on lentils you would not have to be obedient to the king.” </p><p id=""""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br></p><p id="""">There is a kind of simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity. It is simplicity by design, rather than default. It’s born of the understanding that, a lot of times, complexity is just smoke in your eyes. It exists to befuddle and confound you, so that you buy something, or swallow some dogma, or stay in your lane, or follow the rules. So that you tamp down any wild instincts that may ruffle the feathers of the titans of industry, or interrupt the swing thoughts of the leisure class as they head out on the back nine. </p><p id="""">But living a decent life is not so complicated. You could boil down the basic principles: Have dinner together. Don’t get in the car if you don’t have to. Trust your gut. Sing in the shower. Leave it like you found it. And if you feel like punching someone in the face, count to ten. </p><p id="""">The old world has roared back post-pandemic, but under cover of darkness some things had clearly shifted, and now the new arrangement stood revealed. The culture had fractured. In the gulf between tribes, and even in the hairline cracks between formerly like-minded friends and neighbours and spouses, there bloomed a radioactive loneliness on a scale the world has never seen. </p><p id="""">Whatever the precise contours of the new vibe of the 21st century, a big part of it will be a rebuke to the toxic cult of individualism. </p><p id="""">Any culture that loads its young people into a cannon and fires them off somewhere to sit in a room and study or toil until they “make it,” and loads its old people onto ice floes and shoves them off to die without encumbering the rest of us, that culture has lost its way. “Going it alone” is a bullshit creed. The renegade Gen Zers get that. And the cohort coming up behind them will know it in their bones. </p><p id="""">Gen Alpha, inheritors of the 21st century, will bear a new motto: Only Connect. Like: this is only gonna work if we band together. We pool our money so we can afford to do things. Head out in groups of two or three or ten, because any experience is 10x better when it’s shared. Stay connected to our ancestors, to our food sources, to nature itself. Ask for help. Offer it. Huddle up. </p><p id="""">Gen Alpha will resist categorical thinking. That’s not to say they’ll be without biases – no one is. But they’ll have made it a habit to fight those biases. What happens when you do that is ... the lines between things grow fainter. The very idea of categories start to make less and less sense. <em id="""">Everything </em>becomes nonbinary. Not just gender: everything. No teams, just individuals. No who-matters-and-who-doesn’t. </p><p id="""">The yin and yang of Gen Alpha is both amazing and potentially problematic. </p><p id="""">An absence of cynicism is great, because cynicism makes nothing happen. Accepting and gentle and non- judgmental and sweet and hopeful are awesome traits. </p><p id="""">That’s the yin. </p><p id="""">But the yang-ing up: <em id="""">that </em>will be the challenge. </p><p id="""">The yang part is fighting for a dignified existence for every human. It’s scrapping tooth-and-nail for structural change that will make such a lifestyle possible, let alone sustainable, well into a future you will never live to see. It’s questioning the legitimacy of the high priests of the status quo. It’s a hell of a task. Because right now, the corporatocracy is pulling hard against everything you want the world to be. </p><p id="""">So maybe the vibe of the 21st century is contained in a paradox: </p><p id="""">We’ll need to be hard-hearted enough to fight.

Whether it does, it has featured to a growing extent in the “actions,” or protest-performances, of Petr Pavlensky. The Russian-born provocateur first made a sensation of himself when, in 2012, he sewed his lips shut and stood in public protest of the jailing of members of Pussy Riot. (They were convicted of hooliganism for their punk demonstration, within the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, against the Russian Orthodox Church’s support of then-candidate Vladimir Putin.)<br><br>The following year, assistants laid his nude body, wrapped within a tangled nest of barbed wire, before the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg. This action was intended to protest the Russian state’s turning its citizens into “gutless and securely guarded cattle, which can only consume, work, and reproduce.” He was left to be pried free by police.<br><br>The year after, Pavlensky sat, (again) in the nude, before Lenin’s Tomb in Moscow’s Red Square, with a nail driven through his scrotum and into the paving beneath. Pavlensky declared that a “naked artist, looking at his testicles nailed to the cobblestone is a metaphor of apathy, political indifference, and fatalism of Russian society.”<br><br>Two years and as many actions later, he aimed the violence typical of his performances away from himself and towards property. Approaching the Lubyanka Building, infamous headquarters of the KGB (and now its successor, the FSB), Pavlensky doused the main door in gasoline, set it aflame with a cigarette lighter, and awaited his arrest. He repeated the action in Paris, where, in 2017, he set alight the windows of an office of the Bank of France.<br><br>Pavlensky’s transgressive pageantry confirms that carefully fashioned, vaguely symbolic violence, directed at oneself or at property, cannot often fail to provoke widespread shock, and even capture international attention. But how long, in any case, does the attention stand to last? And, if it is not all just for show, how many acts of deliberate, meaningful change does Pavlensky stand to inspire?<br><br>And yet, he has placed no body but his own in harm’s way, and damaged only property that belongs to formidable institutions — which is to say, to those who can more than afford the bill for repairs. On those grounds, Pavlensky’s methods lie outside the sphere of truly intolerable violence. But for his eye-catching theatrics to have the potential to achieve real political purchase, he must do more than simply disturb his audience — by shaking its constituents into a state of greater awareness, imparting on them a greater impetus to act.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f077937886ac78ca4f10978_violence_profiles_pic02_800x444.jpg""></div></figure><p>“Terrorist” is a loaded word, the connotations of which are subject to time and place. It meant something altogether different, at its birth, to the French citizen during Maximilien Robespierre’s Reign of Terror, than to the bourgeois of turn-of-the-century Europe, harried by insurrectionary anarchists’ “propaganda of the deed.” It meant something different to Ireland during three bloody decades of Troubles, than to near-contemporaneous West Germany, then in the homicidal grip of the Red Army Faction. And It meant something different to the world before, and after, the events of the eleventh of September.<br>‍<br>Between activist Scott Crow, on one hand; and the F.B.I. (which has a file open on Crow, who has never been charged, that is more than a decade old), on the other, there is a similar disagreement as to the scope of that heavy word. The agency suspects that the man is a terrorist, while the man maintains that he is nothing of the sort.<br>‍<br>Crow, fifty-two, is a self-described anarchist, organizer (of such initiatives as the Common Ground Collective, which offered relief to victims of Hurricane Katrina), and activist. He also openly endorses the use of violence. “I’ve had death threats. I’ve had guns drawn on me. I’ve drawn guns on fascists. I’ve been in altercations. I’ve smoke-bombed places. I’ve done a myriad of things to try and stop fascism and its flow over the years,” he told CNN earlier this year. “In anti-fascist work,” so called, “a lot of times we’d end up in scuffles and conflicts with neo-Nazis,” who were armed, he remarked in conversation with the CBC’s Piya Chattopadhyay, in 2017. “I would hit them with a bat occasionally.”<br>‍<br>Crow justifies his willingness to engage violently in such skirmishes as a means to deter “fascists,” broadly speaking, from their openly endorsing their creed. “For them to show up in public to speak about genocide and hate,” he claims, “it raises the cost.” Though to what extent such armed, civilian counter-counterdemonstration has sequestered, or can sequester, the proliferation of hatred is not clear. Nor is the efficacy of his fighting the exponents of violence with little besides the very instrument of their choice. For violence alone, without an appeal to principles, can only beget more of the same. Can Crow do much of anything to stop fascism, all but the quintessence of violence, while aping the petty violence that characterizes his purported enemies?</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f07795e886ac730f6f1098d_violence_profiles_pic03_800x444.jpg""></div></figure><p>It is a city of looming towers and chasmic thoroughfares, veritable canyons of concrete and glass. In Hong Kong, there are more skyscrapers — three-hundred and fifty-three — than in any other city on earth. There are also, therefore, more shadows.<br>‍<br>What has transpired in the shadows of these colossal steel pillars these last months is nothing short of historic. Without any central organizing leadership, millions of demonstrators have descended, as if in a fluid mass, on Hong Kong’s riverine streets and roadways. Thousands have marched, chanted, and picketed; gone on strike, formed human chains, and disrupted public life; vandalized, wrecked, and beaten; been beaten, maimed, and jailed. Thousands have risked their livelihoods, even their very lives. Eight have died, all at their own hand, in protest.<br>‍<br>A clear consequence of the protests’ being decentralized is that many strategies and interests, without being vetted, discussed, or approved, have fallen under the anything-goes banner of one amorphous mass. Protestors who advocate non-violent disobedience have marched alongside throwers of petrol-bombs and smashers of windows. Some have carried placards, while others have wielded truncheons. Brutality has been exercised at times intentionally; at others, indiscriminately; and by who, and against whom, it has not always been easy to tell — though far easier to suspect. Further, there is but loose (and often only retroactive) agreement on what means are justified, and what ends are to be settled before the demonstrations are deemed a success. In a crowd without a leader, the mass, if not the mob, rules.<br>‍<br>The risk is that, in escalating the number and severity of violent acts, Hong Kong’s fighters for freedom bring down upon themselves, and all Hong Kong besides, the wrath of their nominal sovereign. Theirs is one, to put it almost indelicately, not favourably disposed to dissent. Only thirty years since (in bleak contrast to the contemporaneous mounting of the Autumn of Nations across Europe, east to the crumbling Soviet Union), demonstrators in their untold numbers fell to the rifles and tanks of Beijing. And there is no telling how patient its present-day rulers will remain before such a moment repeats itself. In that dreary light, the phrase “You’re the ones who taught me peaceful protests don’t work,” seen spray-painted about Hong Kong, seems at once righteous and rash. After all, who are but a minority to take to such violent measures, without consent, on the part of millions? Would that justice could be sought in Hong Kong without summoning the military might, already at the gates, of the CCP.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f07797b52711610814a482a_violence_profiles_pic04_800x444.jpg""></div></figure><p>Roger Hallam knows that his time, and ours, is short. Hence the urgency of his woeful message to the inhabitants of the warming earth — who, without prompt, sweeping change to their collective habits, may find themselves amid the worst and widest threat to human life in history. Hence his fury, aimed at the abetters of the ongoing Sixth Extinction and coeval Climate and Ecological Emergency.<br>‍<br>Hallam, who is fifty-three, is one of a pair of activists to have founded Extinction Rebellion (XR). “[XR] is humbly following in the tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King,” Hallam wrote in The Guardian last May. “We are simply rediscovering what people do when they have had enough of failure and really want to make a difference.” Holding true to the principles of that tradition, he insisted that “[we] have to stay strictly nonviolent.”<br>‍<br>How well has Hallam lived up to his word? The answer to this question lies with his activities carried out under the banner of Heathrow Pause, so called to distance itself from XR. From September 13th to 15th, Hallam and others belonging to Heathrow Pause were arrested in advance of their (forewarned) flying of drones within Heathrow Airport’s five-kilometre “exclusion zone,” with the aim of halting flights to and from London’s principal airfield.<br>‍<br>“This is what the climate emergency means,” Hallam proclaimed, before his arrest, to The Guardian. “A question of life or death. A question of extinction — everyone gone for ever. The only appropriate response now is rebellion. This means demanding an immediate cancellation of the third runway at Heathrow. Stop this planned monstrosity and we will stop flying drones.” He went on: “The consequence of not rebelling is indescribable suffering and death for billions of people. The consequence of rebellion is a chance to avoid the worst. Rebellion means mass economic disruption and deep personal sacrifice. I am a rebel. That’s why I am flying drones at Heathrow.”<br>‍<br>Few if any drones flew successfully at Heathrow. Most either were apprehended before they could be launched, or malfunctioned. (Which may or may not have been the consequence of signal-jamming on the part of the authorities, whether the airport’s or the law’s.) Moreover, no scheduled flights were grounded. But the threat that the drones could have posed, had they in fact flown — was it real? (In the case that it was, it is well and good for Hallam to speak of “deep personal sacrifice,” to which he is by all means welcome. But to volunteer others for sacrifice without their consent is not only unproductive, but immoral.) Or was the stunt designed merely to achieve (as per XR’s tactics) the arrest of those involved — no fewer than nineteen would-be disruptors?<br>‍<br>These beg yet further questions: how far, in the name of life on earth, ought we to go? If extinction or a thousand-year dark age are truly in the cards, what acts are we ready to commit, in good conscience or ill, to stave off the worst? The legacy of today’s struggle on behalf of the climate, and the shape that it will give to the future, rest upon their answers. Whatever we do, our deeds, with our planet, will remain to those not yet born; either as examples — or as warnings.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f0779928d297d71db3026db_violence_profiles_pic05_800x444.jpg""></div></figure><p>“Nothing was your own” in the totalitarian state of Oceania, the setting of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four; “except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.” Yet small as was this islet of grey matter, it offered room enough to gain a foothold of resistance. “Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”<br>‍<br>Twenty-two-year-old Aslan Sagutdinov must have felt a similar conviction as, one May day in his native Kazakhstan, he stood alone in public, holding a placard as barren and white as the day it was made — and, for no other reason, was arrested.<br>‍<br>Sagutdinov, though his sign was blank, might as well have scrawled his message in tall, unmistakable letters. Even the state police understood his meaning well enough; and, by arresting him, did him the favour of proving it right. What is yet more absurd is the insistence, on the part of the local head of police, that Sagutdinov’s transgression lay not with his holding a blank sign, but with his publicly suggesting that “there is no democracy and free speech in Kazakhstan” — as blatant an example of doublespeak, and of hypocrisy, as has ever been uttered. Orwell himself could not have conjured one better.<br>‍<br>As Sagutdinov’s inspired deed all too plainly demonstrates, little is needed to show, or shame, tyranny’s tremulous insecurity. With ingenuity and audacity, much can be said in defence of freedom. This, in spite of such a despotic ban as Kazakhstan’s, not just on free speech, but on any speech. And all without recourse to violence. Perhaps the sign that points towards one vision of dissent’s future, too, is blank.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5e3c96e1e74fc13d50c6a100_violence_profiles_pic01_1080x600.jpg,"Does violence have a place in art?

One word,” whispered the voice of prudence in The Graduate. “Plastics.” Cheap, malleable, disposable, and conducive to mass production, plastic was a byword for the boundless potential of postwar industry. It promised degrees of convenience, thrift, and novelty previously unthinkable of the materials of old. But gradually, it became apparent that plastic had a terrible downside. Alongside other synthetic compounds, plastic waste was migrating beyond the confines of city and landfill into parks, lakes, rivers, and oceans. Its durability, a virtue as a material for consumption, made plastic objects enduring hazards to the natural environment and to its wildlife. Rivers choked on torrents of litter. Islands of rubbish floated on the seas. Seals, turtles, seabirds, and whales, suffocating or ensnared in synthetic mesh, perished in horrible fits of panic. But it wasn’t just the animals who suffered. Human beings were found to be full of the stuff: microplastics had permeated our bodies. Tiny particulates in our food, in our water, drew the filthy pollution from outside in, breeding cancer. And now in the air we breathe, strewn about by the wind to the remotest reaches of wilderness. Scientist Janice Brahney:</p><h4>“There’s no nook or cranny on the surface of the earth that won’t have microplastics.” </h4><p>There is no longer any escape from the fatal plastic mistake.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5f52a89f1d54975678fd0eb2_plastic_girl_welcome_to_plastic_world_590x380.jpg,"“I want to say one word to you.

This contrast, according to the artists, “expresses a brutal and contradicting irony”: “while advances in science and technology augment the devastating impact of human endeavours over wild habitats, so are they our best means of studying and understanding it.” The music of the present — and of a future we may not be able to avoid — is the grim, unceasing chime of a death knell.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/5dcc9da8449e5934a434906a_Gong-Ho.jpg,"With apt gravity, artist-activists Crystelle Vu and Julian Oliver have chosen the solemn timbre of a traditional Chau Gong.

To date, according to Thrall, the U.S. “has granted more than $110 billion to the occupying military force and spent hundreds of millions on upgrading the infrastructure of apartheid.” Blinken reaffirmed that thoroughly amoral position in early March, declaring that the U.S. “firmly opposes and is deeply disappointed” by the International Criminal Court’s opening an investigation into war crimes in occupied Palestine.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/60a6d26b869e904094e37f69_biden_complicit_466x600.gif"" loading=""lazy""></div></figure><blockquote>Diplomats and well-meaning anti-occupation groups greet every new act of Israeli expansion with dire warnings that it will be a 'fatal blow' to the two-state solution, that 'the window is closing' for Palestinian statehood and that now, on the eve of this latest takeover, it is 'five minutes to midnight' for the prospect of peace. Countless alarms of this kind have been rung during the past two decades. Each was supposed to convince Israel, the US, Europe and the rest of the world of the need to stop or at least slow Israel's de facto annexation. But they have had the opposite effect: demonstrating that it will <em>always </em>be five minutes to midnight. European and American policymakers, together with the liberal Zionist groups that lobby them, can thus maintain that the two-state solution isn't dead but merely embattled - and, therefore, permanently 'alive'. In the meantime, millions of Palestinians continue to be deprived of basic civil rights and subjected to military rule. With the exception of those six months in 1966-67, this has been the reality for the majority of Palestinians living under Israeli control for the entire history of the state. South Africa's apartheid lasted 46 years. Israeli's is at 72, and counting.</blockquote><p>-- from The Annexation Delusion by Nathan Thrall in the London Review of Books</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5acfc48421e7a66153389c5f/60a443a7d87af99c95966f92_schumer_pelosi_blinken_biden_900x360.jpg,"These 4 democrats endorse Israel's Apartheid in Palestine: Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Antony Blinken and Joe Biden.",The Third Force,Political,154,Mon May 17 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,,false,,,

How many complaints did Shoppers receive? Does the company follow a codified procedure when deciding to delist?</em> — we were met with a shrug. “I think it’s pretty self explanatory …” was their unsigned final word. Talk about courtesy.<br></p><p>Our attempt to get in touch with Shoppers directly proved predictably futile. Got a question? “Read the FAQs.” Got a complaint? “Call our 1-800 number and wait interminably in on-hold hell.” It turns out that the only feasible way to get a hold of a human being who works for the chain is to contact one of its stores. (There are more than 1,300 across Canada.) In other words: If you’re trying to get through to corporate, get fucked.<br></p><p>Is this how truth-telling journalism dies — at the hands of a few outraged grannies who don’t like naughty words or knowing how their beef gets made?

(Second-place Sobeys, owner of IGA and Safeway, did about half as much business.) Its subsidiaries include President’s Choice, No Frills, and Real Canadian Superstore. If you live up north, chances are you do regular business with the nation-spanning grub-monger in one way or another.<br></p><p>In short, independent mags like ours are at the mercy of just a few big corporate newsstands — basically the only ones left. And their interest doesn’t lie in defending free speech, telling hard truths, or standing up for internationally circulated home-grown publications. It lies in their trembling, knee-knocking bottom line. Can’t afford to put off delicate sensibilities, I guess.<br></p><p>The plain truth is that, even as they die a slow death, no one will defend vital voices like ours . . . except readers like you. <br></p><p>Like what we do?

I consumed 1576 calories – 297 of them from fat. 672 of those calories were subsequently burned by high-impact cardiovascular exercise. Over the course of the day, I used the word “obvious” 46 times – a new personal record. I drank 2.3 cups of coffee. After work, I took a 2467-step hike, the results of which were 2 Instagram photos and a Facebook post, which have so far received a total of 13 likes. After dinner, Sarah and I made love for 7 minutes and 14 seconds (18 minutes if you count foreplay, which lasted 3 minutes longer than usual – we must both be tired). As usual, just before bed we uploaded our data to the Lifelog. Reviewed the data from the previous week. Our rankings were pretty good, stacked up next to the other folks in our building. Shane and Rita next door always seem to have us beat – their lovemaking sessions tend to last at least 16 minutes more than ours do. Although, as Sarah and I always say with a smirk, once the Lifelog learns to discern quality, we’re pretty sure we’ll come out on top. Apparently Rob from downstairs hikes the same trail as me, but his Total Number of Steps is smaller overall. Weird. Note to self: check his height and see if this should be a cause for concern.</p><p>When it first came out, people said the Lifelog was just for cranks. For neurotics, fitness buffs, people desperate to lose weight. But its encroachment into every aspect of our lives happened quickly, effortlessly. To be honest, we welcomed it. Opportunities for competition in daily life are virtually endless. Data giving us a look at the innermost workings of not just the lives of others, but our own. Then came the public Scoreboards, the ranking system, the algorithms using mined data to optimize the human experience.There were, of course, those who resisted. Those who claimed that human interaction couldn’t and shouldn’t be quantified, that to measure it at such a infinitesimal level would be to rob it of any real meaning. That tossing so much personal information into the public realm made us easier targets for companies and marketers to further tailor their offerings to our subconscious desire.Eventually those voices were silenced. People who can’t be measured are dangerous.
